If we can study a thousand very distant &#8220;baby&#8221; galaxies when the universe was 1 billion years old, and another thousand slightly closer &#8220;toddler&#8221; galaxies when it was 2 billion years old, and so on until the present 13.8-billion-year-old universe of mature &#8220;adult&#8221; galaxies near us today, then maybe we can piece together a coherent picture of how the whole ensemble of galaxies evolves over time.

Geologists can take samples of the objects they are studying; chemists can conduct experiments in their laboratories to determine what a substance is made of; archeologists can use carbon dating to determine how old something is. But astronomers can&#8217;t pick up and play with a star or galaxy. As we have seen throughout this book, if they want to know what galaxies are made of and how they have changed over the lifetime of the universe, they must decode the messages carried by the small number of photons that reach Earth.</p><p id="m59970-fs-id1163974245410"><span id="m59970-fs-id1163974245410"> </span>Fortunately (as you have learned) electromagnetic radiation is a rich source of information. The distance to a galaxy is derived from its <span class="emphasis"><em>redshift</em></span> (how much the lines in its spectrum are shifted to the red because of the expansion of the universe). The conversion of redshift to a distance depends on certain properties of the universe, including the value of the Hubble constant and how much mass it contains. We will describe the currently accepted model of the universe in <a class="link target-chapter" href="ch29.html#m59975" title="29..&#160;Thinking Ahead">The Big Bang</a>. For the purposes of this chapter, it is enough to know that the current best estimate for the age of the universe is 13.8 billion years. In that case, if we see an object that emitted its light 6 billion light-years ago, we are seeing it as it was when the universe was almost 8 billion years old. If we see something that emitted its light 13 billion years ago, we are seeing it as it was when the universe was less than a billion years old. So astronomers measure a galaxy&#8217;s redshift from its spectrum, use the Hubble constant plus a model of the universe to turn the redshift into a distance, and use the distance and the constant speed of light to infer how far back in time they are seeing the galaxy&#8212;the look-back time.</p><p id="m59970-fs-id1163975680024"><span id="m59970-fs-id1163975680024"> </span>In addition to distance and look-back time, studies of the Doppler shifts of a galaxy&#8217;s spectral lines can tell us how fast the galaxy is rotating and hence how massive it is (as explained in <a class="link target-chapter" href="ch26.html#m59956" title="26..&#160;Thinking Ahead">Galaxies</a>). Detailed analysis of such lines can also indicate the types of stars that inhabit a galaxy and whether it contains large amounts of interstellar matter.</p><p id="m59970-fs-id1163974243702"><span id="m59970-fs-id1163974243702"> </span>Unfortunately, many galaxies are so faint that collecting enough light to produce a detailed spectrum is currently impossible. Astronomers thus have to use a much rougher guide to estimate what kinds of stars inhabit the faintest galaxies&#8212;their overall colors. Look again at <a class="xref target-figure" href="ch28.html#m59970-OSC_Astro_28_01_Abell2744" title="Figure&#160;28.2.&#160;Astronomical Time Travel.">Figure&#160;28.2</a> and notice that some of the galaxies are very blue and others are reddish-orange. Now remember that hot, luminous blue stars are very massive and have lifetimes of only a few million years. If we see a galaxy where blue colors dominate, we know that it must have many hot, luminous blue stars, and that star formation must have taken place in the few million years before the light left the galaxy. In a yellow or red galaxy, on the other hand, the young, luminous blue stars that surely were made in the galaxy&#8217;s early bursts of star formation must have died already; it must contain mostly old yellow and red stars that last a long time in their main-sequence stages and thus typically formed billions of years before the light that we now see was emitted.</p><p id="m59970-fs-id1163974289507"><span id="m59970-fs-id1163974289507"> </span>Another important clue to the nature of a galaxy is its shape. Spiral galaxies can be distinguished from elliptical galaxies by shape. Observations show that spiral galaxies contain young stars and large amounts of interstellar matter, while elliptical galaxies have mostly old stars and very little or no star formation. Elliptical galaxies turned most of their interstellar matter into stars many billions of years ago, while star formation has continued until the present day in spiral galaxies.</p><p id="m59970-fs-id1163974222654"><span id="m59970-fs-id1163974222654"> </span>If we can count the number of galaxies of each type during each epoch of the universe, it will help us understand how the pace of star formation changes with time.

Since stars are the source of nearly all the light emitted by galaxies, we can learn a lot about the evolution of galaxies by studying the stars within them. What we find is that nearly all galaxies contain at least some very old stars. For example, our own Galaxy contains globular clusters with stars that are at least 13 billion years old, and some may be even older than that. Therefore, if we count the age of the Milky Way as the age of its oldest constituents, the Milky Way must have been born at least 13 billion years ago.</p><p id="m59970-fs-id1163974375348"><span id="m59970-fs-id1163974375348"> </span>As we will discuss in <a class="link target-chapter" href="ch29.html#m59975" title="29..&#160;Thinking Ahead">The Big Bang</a>, astronomers have discovered that the universe is expanding, and have traced the expansion backward in time. In this way, they have discovered that the universe itself is only about 13.8 billion years old. Thus, it appears that at least some of the globular-cluster stars in the Milky Way must have formed less than a billion years after the expansion began.</p><p id="m59970-fs-id1163974232264"><span id="m59970-fs-id1163974232264"> </span>Several other observations also establish that star formation in the cosmos began very early. Astronomers have used spectra to determine the composition of some elliptical galaxies that are so far away that the light we see left them when the universe was only half as old as it is now. Yet these ellipticals contain old red stars, which must have formed billions of years earlier still.</p><p id="m59970-fs-id1163974234802"><span id="m59970-fs-id1163974234802"> </span>When we make computer models of how such galaxies evolve with time, they tell us that star formation in elliptical galaxies began less than a billion years or so after the universe started its expansion, and new stars continued to form for a few billion years. But then star formation apparently stopped. When we compare distant elliptical galaxies with ones nearby, we find that ellipticals have not changed very much since the universe reached about half its current age. We&#8217;ll return to this idea later in the chapter.</p><p id="m59970-fs-id1163975290197"><span id="m59970-fs-id1163975290197"> </span>Observations of the most luminous galaxies take us even further back in time. Recently, as we have already noted, astronomers have discovered a few galaxies that are so far away that the light we see now left them less than a billion years or so after the beginning (<a class="xref target-figure" href="ch28.html#m59970-OSC_Astro_28_01_Distant" title="Figure&#160;28.3.&#160;Very Distant Galaxy.">Figure&#160;28.3</a>). Yet the spectra of some of these galaxies already contain lines of heavy elements, including carbon, silicon, aluminum, and sulfur. These elements were not present when the universe began but had to be manufactured in the interiors of stars. This means that when the light from these galaxies was emitted, an entire generation of stars had already been born, lived out their lives, and died&#8212;spewing out the new elements made in their interiors through supernova explosions&#8212;even before the universe was a billion years old. And it wasn&#8217;t just a few stars in each galaxy that got started this way.

This hypothesis was similar to suggesting that human beings were born as adults and did not have to pass through the various stages of development from infancy through the teens. If this hypothesis were correct, the most distant galaxies should have shapes and sizes very much like the galaxies we see nearby. According to this old view, galaxies, after they formed, should then change only slowly, as successive generations of stars within them formed, evolved, and died. As the interstellar matter was slowly used up and fewer new stars formed, the galaxies would gradually become dominated by fainter, older stars and look dimmer and dimmer.</p><p id="m59970-fs-id1163974235920"><span id="m59970-fs-id1163974235920"> </span>Thanks to the new generation of large ground- and space-based telescopes, we now know that this picture of galaxies evolving peacefully and in isolation from one another is completely wrong. As we will see later in this chapter, galaxies in the distant universe do not look like the Milky Way and nearby galaxies such as Andromeda, and the story of their development is more complex and involves far more interaction with their neighbors.</p><p id="m59970-fs-id1163975567738"><span id="m59970-fs-id1163975567738"> </span>Why were astronomers so wrong? Up until the early 1990s, the most distant normal galaxy that had been observed emitted its light 8 billion years ago. Since that time, many galaxies&#8212;and particularly the giant ellipticals, which are the most luminous and therefore the easiest to see at large distances&#8212;did evolve peacefully and slowly. But the Hubble, Spitzer, Herschel, Keck, and other powerful new telescopes that have come on line since the 1990s make it possible to pierce the 8-billion-light-year barrier. We now have detailed views of many thousands of galaxies that emitted their light much earlier (some more than 13 billion years ago&#8212;see <a class="xref target-figure" href="ch28.html#m59970-OSC_Astro_28_01_Distant" title="Figure&#160;28.3.&#160;Very Distant Galaxy.">Figure&#160;28.3</a>).</p><p id="m59970-fs-id1163975553776"><span id="m59970-fs-id1163975553776"> </span>Much of the recent work on the evolution of galaxies has progressed by studying a few specific small regions of the sky where the Hubble, Spitzer, and ground-based telescopes have taken extremely long exposure images.

Let&#8217;s use our Sun as an example. The Sun is about 1.4 million kilometers wide, but is separated from the closest other star by about 4 light-years, or about 38 trillion kilometers. In other words, the Sun is 27 million of its own diameters from its nearest neighbor. If the Sun were a grapefruit in New York City, the nearest star would be another grapefruit in San Francisco. This is typical of stars that are not in the nuclear bulge of a galaxy or inside star clusters.

We have three satellite galaxies that are just one or two Milky Way diameters away from us (and will probably someday collide with us). The closest major spiral is the Andromeda Galaxy (M31), about 2.4 million light-years away. If the Milky Way were a pancake at one end of a big breakfast table, M31 would be another pancake at the other end of the same table. Our nearest large galaxy neighbor is only 24 of our Galaxy&#8217;s diameters from us, and it will begin to crash into the Milky Way in about 3 billion years.</p><p id="m59971-fs-id1163976902090"><span id="m59971-fs-id1163976902090"> </span>Galaxies in rich clusters are even closer together than those in our neighborhood (see <a class="link target-chapter" href="ch28.html#m59972" title="28.3.&#160;The Distribution of Galaxies in Space">The Distribution of Galaxies in Space</a>).

Do clusters of galaxies gather together? To answer this question, we must be able to map large parts of the universe in three dimensions. We must know not only the position of each galaxy on the sky (that&#8217;s two dimensions) but also its distance from us (the third dimension).</p><p id="m59972-fs-id1163975430493"><span id="m59972-fs-id1163975430493"> </span>This means we must be able to measure the redshift of each galaxy in our map. Taking a spectrum of each individual galaxy to do this is a much more time-consuming task than simply counting galaxies seen in different directions on the sky, as Hubble did. Today, astronomers have found ways to get the spectra of many galaxies in the same field of view (sometimes hundreds or even thousands at a time) to cut down the time it takes to finish their three-dimensional maps. Larger telescopes are also able to measure the redshifts&#8212;and therefore the distances&#8212;of much more distant galaxies and (again) to do so much more quickly than previously possible.</p><p id="m59972-fs-id1163975331502"><span id="m59972-fs-id1163975331502"> </span>Another challenge astronomers faced in deciding how to go about constructing a map of the universe is similar to that confronted by the first team of explorers in a huge, uncharted territory on Earth. Since there is only one band of explorers and an enormous amount of land, they have to make choices about where to go first. One strategy might be to strike out in a straight line in order to get a sense of the terrain. They might, for example, cross some mostly empty prairies and then hit a dense forest. As they make their way through the forest, they learn how thick it is in the direction they are traveling, but not its width to their left or right. Then a river crosses their path; as they wade across, they can measure its width but learn nothing about its length. Still, as they go on in their straight line, they begin to get some sense of what the landscape is like and can make at least part of a map. Other explorers, striking out in other directions, will someday help fill in the remaining parts of that map.</p><p id="m59972-fs-id1163975372510"><span id="m59972-fs-id1163975372510"> </span>Astronomers have traditionally had to make the same sort of choices. We cannot explore the universe in every direction to infinite &#8220;depth&#8221; or sensitivity: there are far too many galaxies and far too few telescopes to do the job. But we can pick a single direction or a small slice of the sky and start mapping the galaxies.

Some people worried that Newton&#8217;s laws may simply not work so far out in our solar system.

When the first sensitive X-ray telescopes were launched into orbit around Earth in the 1970s and trained on massive galaxy clusters, it was quickly discovered that the clusters emit copious X-ray radiation (see <a class="xref target-figure" href="ch28.html#m59973-OSC_Astro_28_04_abell1689" title="Figure&#160;28.25.&#160;X-Ray Image of a Galaxy Cluster.">Figure&#160;28.25</a>).

The particles in these huge reservoirs of gas are not just sitting still; rather, they are constantly moving, zooming around under the influence of the cluster&#8217;s immense gravity like mini planets around a giant sun. As they move and bump against each other, the gas heats up hotter and hotter until, at temperatures as high as 100 million K, it shines brightly at X-ray wavelengths. The more mass the cluster has, the faster the motions, the hotter the gas, and the brighter the X-rays. Astronomers calculate that the mass present to induce those motions must be about ten times the mass they can see in the clusters, including all the galaxies and all the gas. Once again, this is evidence that the galaxy clusters are seen to be dominated by dark matter.</p><div id="m59973-OSC_Astro_28_04_abell1689" class="figure"><div class="body"><div class="mediaobject" id="m59973-fs-id1163976607381"><span id="m59973-fs-id1163976607381"> </span><img src="m59973/OSC_Astro_28_04_Abell1689.jpg" alt="X-ray Image of a Galaxy Cluster.

The first asserts that massive elliptical galaxies formed in a single, rapid collapse of gas and dark matter, during which virtually all the gas was turned quickly into stars.

Observations also indicate that most of the gas in elliptical galaxies was converted to stars by the time the universe was about 3 billion years old, so it appears that elliptical galaxies have not formed many new stars since then. They are often said to be &#8220;red and dead&#8221;&#8212;that is, they mostly contain old, cool, red stars, and there is little or no new star formation going on.</p><p id="m59974-fs-id1163976519361"><span id="m59974-fs-id1163976519361"> </span>These observations (when considered together) suggest that the giant elliptical galaxies that we see nearby formed from a combination of both top-down and bottom-up mechanisms, with the most massive galaxies forming in the densest clusters where both processes happened very early and quickly in the history of the universe.</p><p id="m59974-fs-id1163976749527"><span id="m59974-fs-id1163976749527"> </span>The situation with spiral galaxies is apparently very different.

Initially, as we said, the distribution of matter (both luminous and dark) was nearly, but not quite exactly, smooth and uniform. That &#8220;not quite&#8221; is the key to everything. Here and there were lumps where the density of matter (both luminous and dark) was ever so slightly higher than average.</p><p id="m59974-fs-id1163973236801"><span id="m59974-fs-id1163973236801"> </span>Initially, each individual lump expanded because the whole universe was expanding. However, as the universe continued to expand, the regions of higher density acquired still more mass because they exerted a slightly larger than average gravitational force on surrounding material. If the inward pull of gravity was high enough, the denser individual regions ultimately stopped expanding. They then began to collapse into irregularly shaped blobs (that&#8217;s the technical term astronomers use!). In many regions the collapse was more rapid in one direction, so the concentrations of matter were not spherical but came to resemble giant clumps, pancakes, and rope-like filaments&#8212;each much larger than individual galaxies.</p><p id="m59974-fs-id1163973141988"><span id="m59974-fs-id1163973141988"> </span>These elongated clumps existed throughout the early universe, oriented in different directions and collapsing at different rates. The clumps provided the framework for the large-scale filamentary and bubble-like structures that we see preserved in the universe today.</p><p id="m59974-fs-id1163973109964"><span id="m59974-fs-id1163973109964"> </span>The universe then proceeded to &#8220;build itself&#8221; from the bottom up. Within the clumps, smaller structures formed first, then merged to build larger ones, like Lego pieces being put together one by one to create a giant Lego metropolis. The first dense concentrations of matter that collapsed were the size of small dwarf galaxies or globular clusters&#8212;which helps explain why globular clusters are the oldest things in the Milky Way and most other galaxies. These fragments then gradually assembled to build galaxies, galaxy clusters, and, ultimately, superclusters of galaxies.</p><p id="m59974-fs-id1163976887131"><span id="m59974-fs-id1163976887131"> </span>According to this picture, small galaxies and large star clusters first formed in the highest density regions of all&#8212;the filaments and nodes where the pancakes intersect&#8212;when the universe was about two percent of its current age. Some stars may have formed even before the first star clusters and galaxies came into existence. Some galaxy-galaxy collisions triggered massive bursts of star formation, and some of these led to the formation of black holes. In that rich, crowded environment, black holes found constant food and grew in mass. The development of massive black holes then triggered quasars and other active galactic nuclei whose powerful outflows of energy and matter shut off the star formation in their host galaxies. The early universe must have been an exciting place!</p><p id="m59974-fs-id1163976548826"><span id="m59974-fs-id1163976548826"> </span>Clusters of galaxies then formed as individual galaxies congregated, drawn together by their mutual gravitational attraction (<a class="xref target-figure" href="ch28.html#m59974-OSC_Astro_28_05_ClusterFrm" title="Figure&#160;28.30.&#160;Formation of Cluster of Galaxies.">Figure&#160;28.30</a>). First, a few galaxies came together to form groups, much like our own Local Group. Then the groups began combining to form clusters and, eventually, superclusters.

We have now seen galaxies as they were when the universe was about 500 million years old&#8212;only about four percent as old as it is now. The universe now is 13.8 billion years old. The color of a galaxy is an indicator of the age of the stars that populate it. Blue galaxies must contain a lot of hot, massive, young stars. Galaxies that contain only old stars tend to be yellowish red. The first generation of stars formed when the universe was only a few hundred million years old. Galaxies observed when the universe was only a few billion years old tend to be smaller than today&#8217;s galaxies, to have more irregular shapes, and to have more rapid star formation than the galaxies we see nearby in today&#8217;s universe. This shows that the smaller galaxy fragments assembled themselves into the larger galaxies we see today.</p></div></div><div class="section"><div class="title"><a href="#m59971"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated"/><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-n">28.2</span><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated">.&#160;</span><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t">Galaxy Mergers and Active Galactic Nuclei</span></a></div><div class="body"><p id="m59971-fs-id1163973259401"><span id="m59971-fs-id1163973259401"> </span>When galaxies of comparable size collide and coalesce we call it a merger, but when a small galaxy is swallowed by a much larger one, we use the term galactic cannibalism. Collisions play an important role in the evolution of galaxies. If the collision involves at least one galaxy rich in interstellar matter, the resulting compression of the gas will result in a burst of star formation, leading to a starburst galaxy. Mergers were much more common when the universe was young, and many of the most distant galaxies that we see are starburst galaxies that are involved in collisions. Active galactic nuclei powered by supermassive black holes in the centers of most galaxies can have major effects on the host galaxy, including shutting off star formation.</p></div></div><div class="section"><div class="title"><a href="#m59972"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated"/><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-n">28.3</span><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated">.&#160;</span><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t">The Distribution of Galaxies in Space</span></a></div><div class="body"><p id="m59972-fs-id1163974444042"><span id="m59972-fs-id1163974444042"> </span>Counts of galaxies in various directions establish that the universe on the large scale is homogeneous and isotropic (the same everywhere and the same in all directions, apart from evolutionary changes with time). The sameness of the universe everywhere is referred to as the cosmological principle. Galaxies are grouped together in clusters. The Milky Way Galaxy is a member of the Local Group, which contains at least 54 member galaxies. Rich clusters (such as Virgo and Coma) contain thousands or tens of thousands of galaxies. Galaxy clusters often group together with other clusters to form large-scale structures called superclusters, which can extend over distances of several hundred million light-years. Clusters and superclusters are found in filamentary structures that are huge but fill only a small fraction of space. Most of space consists of large voids between superclusters, with nearly all galaxies confined to less than 10% of the total volume.</p></div></div><div class="section"><div class="title"><a href="#m59973"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated"/><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-n">28.4</span><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated">.&#160;</span><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t">The Challenge of Dark Matter</span></a></div><div class="body"><p id="m59973-fs-id1163976561859"><span id="m59973-fs-id1163976561859"> </span>Stars move much faster in their orbits around the centers of galaxies, and galaxies around centers of galaxy clusters, than they should according to the gravity of all the luminous matter (stars, gas, and dust) astronomers can detect. This discrepancy implies that galaxies and galaxy clusters are dominated by dark matter rather than normal luminous matter. Gravitational lensing and X-ray radiation from massive galaxy clusters confirm the presence of dark matter. Galaxies and clusters of galaxies contain about 10 times more dark matter than luminous matter. While some of the dark matter may be made up of ordinary matter (protons, neutrons, and electrons), perhaps in the form of very faint stars or black holes, most of it probably consists of some totally new type of particle not yet detected on Earth. Observations of gravitational lensing effects on distant objects have been used to look in the outer region of our Galaxy for any dark matter in the form of compact, dim stars or star remnants, but not enough such objects have been found to account for all the dark matter.</p></div></div><div class="section"><div class="title"><a href="#m59974"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated"/><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-n">28.5</span><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated">.&#160;</span><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t">The Formation and Evolution of Galaxies and Structure in the Universe</span></a></div><div class="body"><p id="m59974-fs-id1163973130020"><span id="m59974-fs-id1163973130020"> </span>Initially, luminous and dark matter in the universe was distributed almost&#8212;but not quite&#8212;uniformly. The challenge for galaxy formation theories is to show how this &#8220;not quite&#8221; smooth distribution of matter developed the structures&#8212;galaxies and galaxy clusters&#8212;that we see today. It is likely that the filamentary distribution of galaxies and voids was built in near the beginning, before stars and galaxies began to form. The first condensations of matter were about the mass of a large star cluster or a small galaxy. These smaller structures then merged over cosmic time to form large galaxies, clusters of galaxies, and superclusters of galaxies. Superclusters today are still gathering up more galaxies, gas, and dark matter. And spiral galaxies like the Milky Way are still acquiring material by capturing small galaxies near them.</p></div></div></div><!--CNX: Start Area: "For Further Exploration"--><div class="cnx-eoc further-exploration"><div class="title"><span>For Further Exploration</span></div><div class="section empty"><div class="title"><a href="#m59969"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated"/><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-n">28.</span><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated">.&#160;</span><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t">Thinking Ahead</span></a></div><div class="body"/></div><div class="section empty"><div class="title"><a href="#m59970"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated"/><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-n">28.1</span><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated">.&#160;</span><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t">Observations of Distant Galaxies</span></a></div><div class="body"/></div><div class="section empty"><div class="title"><a href="#m59971"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated"/><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-n">28.2</span><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated">.&#160;</span><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t">Galaxy Mergers and Active Galactic Nuclei</span></a></div><div class="body"/></div><div class="section empty"><div class="title"><a href="#m59972"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated"/><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-n">28.3</span><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated">.&#160;</span><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t">The Distribution of Galaxies in Space</span></a></div><div class="body"/></div><div class="section empty"><div class="title"><a href="#m59973"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated"/><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-n">28.4</span><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated">.&#160;</span><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t">The Challenge of Dark Matter</span></a></div><div class="body"/></div><div class="section"><div class="title"><a href="#m59974"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated"/><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-n">28.5</span><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated">.&#160;</span><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t">The Formation and Evolution of Galaxies and Structure in the Universe</span></a></div><div class="body"><div class="section" id="m59974-fs-id1163976519242"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 id="m59974-fs-id1163976519242"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated"/><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t">Articles</span></h4></div></div></div><p id="m59974-fs-id1163976747955"><span id="m59974-fs-id1163976747955"> </span>Andrews, B. &#8220;What Are Galaxies Trying to Tell Us?&#8221; <span class="emphasis"><em>Astronomy</em></span> (February 2011): 24.

Have your group discuss whether it would resemble the development of structure in the universe (as we have described it in this chapter). What elements of your model for NYC resemble the astronomers&#8217; model for the growth of structure in the universe? Which elements do not match?</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Most astronomers believe that dark matter exists and is a large fraction of the total matter in the universe. At the same time, most astronomers do not believe that UFOs are evidence that we are being visited by aliens from another world. Yet astronomers have never actually seen either dark matter or a UFO. Why do you think one idea is widely accepted by scientists and the other is not? Which idea do you think is more believable? Give your reasoning.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Someone in your group describes the redshift surveys of galaxies to a friend, who says he&#8217;s never heard of a bigger waste of effort. Who cares, he asks, about the large-scale structure of the universe? What is your group&#8217;s reaction, and what reasons could you come up with for putting money into figuring out how the universe is organized?</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>The leader of a small but very wealthy country is obsessed by maps. She has put together a fabulous collection of Earth maps, purchased all the maps of other planets that astronomers have assembled, and now wants to commission the best possible map of the entire universe. Your group is selected to advise her. What sort of instruments and surveys should she invest in to produce a good map of the cosmos? Be as specific as you can.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Download a high-resolution image of a rich galaxy cluster from the Hubble Space Telescope (see the list of gravitational lens news stories in the &#8220;For Further Exploration&#8221; section). See if your group can work together to identify gravitational arcs, the images of distant background galaxies distorted by the mass of the cluster. How many can you find? Can you identify any multiple images of the same background galaxy? (If anyone in the group gets really interested, there is a Citizen Science project called Spacewarps, where you can help astronomers identify gravitational lenses on their images: https://spacewarps.org.)</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>You get so excited about gravitational lensing that you begin to talk about it with an intelligent friend who has not yet taken an astronomy course. After hearing you out, this friend starts to worry. He says, &#8220;If gravitational lenses can distort quasar images, sometimes creating multiple, or ghost, images of the same object, then how can we trust any point of light in the sky to be real? Maybe many of the stars we see are just ghost images or lensed images too!&#8221; Have your group discuss how to respond. (Hint: Think about the path that the light of a quasar took on its way to us and the path the light of a typical star takes.)</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>The 8.4-meter Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST), currently under construction atop Cerro Pach&#243;n, a mountain in northern Chile, will survey the entire sky with its 3.2-gigapixel camera every few days, looking for transient, or temporary, objects that make a brief appearance in the sky before fading from view, including asteroids and Kuiper belt objects in our solar system, and supernovae and other explosive high-energy events in the distant universe. When it&#8217;s fully operating sometime after 2021, the LSST will produce up to 30 terabytes of data <span class="emphasis"><em>every night.</em></span> (A terabyte is 1000 gigabytes, which is the unit you probably use to rate your computer or memory stick capacity.) With your group, consider what you think might be some challenges of dealing with that quantity of data every night in a scientifically productive but efficient way. Can you propose any solutions to those challenges?</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Quasars are rare now but were much more numerous when the universe was about one-quarter of its current age. The total star formation taking place in galaxies across the universe peaked at about the same redshift. Does your group think this is a coincidence? Why or why not?</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>One way to see how well the ideas in astronomy (like those in this chapter) have penetrated popular culture is to see whether you can find astronomical words in the marketplace. A short web search for the term &#8220;dark matter&#8221; turns up both a brand of coffee and a brand of &#8220;muscle growth accelerator&#8221; with that name. How many other terms used in this chapter can your group find in the world of products? (What&#8217;s a really popular type of Android cell phone, for example?)</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>What&#8217;s your complete address in the universe? Group members should write out their full address, based on the information in this chapter (and the rest of the book). After your postal code and country, you may want to add continent, planet, planetary system, galaxy, etc. Then each group member should explain this address to a family member or student not taking astronomy.</p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><!--CNX: Start Area: "Review Questions"--><div class="cnx-eoc review-questions"><div class="title"><span>Review Questions</span></div><div class="section empty"><div class="title"><a href="#m59969"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated"/><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-n">28.</span><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated">.&#160;</span><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t">Thinking Ahead</span></a></div><div class="body"/></div><div class="section empty"><div class="title"><a href="#m59970"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated"/><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-n">28.1</span><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated">.&#160;</span><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t">Observations of Distant Galaxies</span></a></div><div class="body"/></div><div class="section empty"><div class="title"><a href="#m59971"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated"/><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-n">28.2</span><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated">.&#160;</span><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t">Galaxy Mergers and Active Galactic Nuclei</span></a></div><div class="body"/></div><div class="section empty"><div class="title"><a href="#m59972"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated"/><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-n">28.3</span><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated">.&#160;</span><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t">The Distribution of Galaxies in Space</span></a></div><div class="body"/></div><div class="section empty"><div class="title"><a href="#m59973"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated"/><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-n">28.4</span><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated">.&#160;</span><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t">The Challenge of Dark Matter</span></a></div><div class="body"/></div><div class="section"><div class="title"><a href="#m59974"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated"/><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-n">28.5</span><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated">.&#160;</span><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t">The Formation and Evolution of Galaxies and Structure in the Universe</span></a></div><div class="body"><div xmlns:ncx="http://www.daisy.org/z3986/2005/ncx/" id="m59974-fs-id1163973173033" class="exercise"><!--calling formal.object--><div class="title"><span><span class="cnx-gentext-exercise cnx-gentext-autogenerated">Exercise </span><span class="cnx-gentext-exercise cnx-gentext-n">1.</span></span></div><div class="body"><!--calling informal.object--><div class="problem" id="m59974-fs-id1163976959450"><span id="m59974-fs-id1163976959450"> </span>

In science, we always have to check to see whether some conclusion is contradicted by any other information we have. In this case, we can ask whether the voids would have filled up with galaxies in roughly 14 billion years. Observations show that in addition to the motion associated with the expansion of the universe, the galaxies in the walls of the voids are moving in random directions at typical speeds of 300 km/s. At least some of them will be moving into the voids. How far into the void will a galaxy move in 14 billion years? Is it a reasonable hypothesis that the voids have existed for 14 billion years?</p>

Suppose you merge two of those together, then merge two larger pieces together, and so on, Lego-style, until you reach a Milky Way mass, about 10<sup>12</sup> solar masses. How many merger generations would that take, and how many original pieces? (Hint: Think in powers of 2.)</p>
