Although the detailed calculations of general relativity do involve a good deal of higher mathematics, the basic ideas are not difficult to understand (and are, in fact, almost poetic in the way they give us a new perspective on the world). Moreover, general relativity goes beyond Newton&#8217;s famous &#8220;inverse-square&#8221; law of gravity; it helps <span class="emphasis"><em>explain</em></span> how matter interacts with other matter in space and time.

She has no idea how it happened but notices that she is weightless. This could be because she and the laboratory are far away from any source of gravity, and both are either at rest or moving at some steady speed through space (in which case she has plenty of time to wake up).

In the nineteenth century, however, it was observed that the actual advance is 574 arcsec per century. The discrepancy was first pointed out in 1859 by Urbain Le Verrier, the codiscoverer of Neptune. Just as discrepancies in the motion of Uranus allowed astronomers to discover the presence of Neptune, so it was thought that the discrepancy in the motion of Mercury could mean the presence of an undiscovered inner planet. Astronomers searched for this planet near the Sun, even giving it a name: Vulcan, after the Roman god of fire.

The result is to make the major axis of Mercury&#8217;s orbit rotate slowly in space because of the Sun&#8217;s gravity alone. The prediction of general relativity is that the direction of perihelion should change by an additional 43 arcsec per century. This is remarkably close to the observed discrepancy, and it gave Einstein a lot of confidence as he advanced his theory.

Einstein&#8217;s theory predicts that such a cobalt clock on the ground floor, being a bit closer to Earth&#8217;s center of gravity, should run very slightly slower than the same clock on the top floor. This is precisely what the experiments observed. Later, atomic clocks were taken up in high-flying aircraft and even on one of the Gemini space flights. In each case, the clocks farther from Earth ran a bit faster. While in 1959 it didn&#8217;t matter much if the clock at the top of the building ran faster than the clock in the basement, today that effect is highly relevant.

Suppose you want to know where you are within 50 feet (GPS devices can actually do much better than this).

Doubling the mass will make the black hole 6 kilometers in radius, still very tiny on the cosmic scale.</p><p id="m59943-fs-id1168048506137"><span id="m59943-fs-id1168048506137"> </span>The event horizons of more massive black holes have larger radii. For example, if a globular cluster of 100,000 stars (solar masses) could collapse to a black hole, it would be 300,000 kilometers in radius, a little less than half the radius of the Sun. If the entire Galaxy could collapse to a black hole, it would be only about 10<sup>12</sup> kilometers in radius&#8212;about a tenth of a light year. Smaller masses have correspondingly smaller horizons: for Earth to become a black hole, it would have to be compressed to a radius of only 1 centimeter&#8212;less than the size of a grape. A typical asteroid, if crushed to a small enough size to be a black hole, would have the dimensions of an atomic nucleus.</p><div id="m59943-fs-id1168048737167" class="example"><div class="title"><span><span class="cnx-gentext-example cnx-gentext-autogenerated">Example&#160;</span><span class="cnx-gentext-example cnx-gentext-n">24.1</span><span class="cnx-gentext-example cnx-gentext-autogenerated">.&#160;</span><span class="cnx-gentext-example cnx-gentext-t"/></span></div><div class="body"><p id="m59943-fs-id1168048304760"><span id="m59943-fs-id1168048304760"> </span></p><div class="title"><b>The Milky Way&#8217;s Black Hole</b></div><p>

The astronaut leaves in the year 2222, just after graduating from college at age 22. She takes, let&#8217;s say, exactly 10 years to get to the black hole.

That&#8217;s equal to 40 years, meaning her classmates will be senior citizens in their 80s when she (a mere 42-year-old) returns.

Let&#8217;s take up an observing position a long, safe distance away from the event horizon and watch this astronaut fall toward it. At first he falls away from us, moving ever faster, just as though he were approaching any massive star. However, as he nears the event horizon of the black hole, things change. The strong gravitational field around the black hole will make his clocks run more slowly, when seen from our outside perspective.</p><p id="m59943-fs-id1168048740989"><span id="m59943-fs-id1168048740989"> </span>If, as he approaches the event horizon, he sends out a signal once per second according to his clock, we will see the spacing between his signals grow longer and longer until it becomes infinitely long when he reaches the event horizon.

What each observer measures about the world depends on (is relative to) his or her frame of reference.

Once inside the event horizon, the astronaut, along with any signals from his radio transmitter, will remain hidden forever from the universe outside. He will, however, not have a long time (from his perspective) to feel sorry for himself as he approaches the black hole. Suppose he is falling feet first. The force of gravity that the singularity exerts on his feet is greater than on his head, so he will be stretched slightly. Because the singularity is a point, the left side of his body will be pulled slightly toward the right, and the right slightly toward the left, bringing each side closer to the singularity. The astronaut will therefore be slightly squeezed in one direction and stretched in the other. Some scientists like to call this process of stretching and narrowing <span class="emphasis"><em>spaghettification.</em></span> The point at which the astronaut becomes so stretched that he perishes depends on the size of the black hole. For black holes with masses billions of times the mass of the Sun, such as those found at the centers of galaxies, the spaghettification becomes significant only after the astronaut passes through the event horizon.

If both stars are visible, neither can be a black hole, so focus your attention on just those systems where only one star of the pair is visible, even with our most sensitive telescopes.</p><p id="m59944-fs-id1168048748809"><span id="m59944-fs-id1168048748809"> </span>Being invisible is not enough, however, because a relatively faint star might be hard to see next to the glare of a brilliant companion or if it is shrouded by dust. And even if the star really is invisible, it could be a neutron star. Therefore, we must also have evidence that the unseen star has a mass too high to be a neutron star and that it is a collapsed object&#8212;an extremely small stellar remnant.</p><p id="m59944-fs-id1168048415375"><span id="m59944-fs-id1168048415375"> </span>We can use Kepler&#8217;s law (see <a class="link target-chapter" href="ch03.html#m59773" title="3..&#160;Thinking Ahead">Orbits and Gravity</a>) and our knowledge of the visible star to measure the mass of the invisible member of the pair. If the mass is greater than about 3 <span class="emphasis"><em>M</em></span><sub>Sun</sub>, then we are likely seeing (or, more precisely, not seeing) a black hole&#8212;as long as we can make sure the object really is a collapsed star.</p><p id="m59944-fs-id1168048354800"><span id="m59944-fs-id1168048354800"> </span>If matter falls toward a compact object of high gravity, the material is accelerated to high speed. Near the event horizon of a black hole, matter is moving at velocities that approach the speed of light. As the atoms whirl chaotically toward the event horizon, they rub against each other; internal friction can heat them to temperatures of 100 million K or more. Such hot matter emits radiation in the form of flickering X-rays. The last part of our prescription, then, is to look for a source of X-rays associated with the binary system. Since X-rays do not penetrate Earth&#8217;s atmosphere, such sources must be found using X-ray telescopes in space.</p><p id="m59944-fs-id1168048572544"><span id="m59944-fs-id1168048572544"> </span>In our example, the infalling gas that produces the X-ray emission comes from the black hole&#8217;s companion star. As we saw in <a class="link target-chapter" href="ch23.html#m59931" title="23..&#160;Thinking Ahead">The Death of Stars</a>, stars in close binary systems can exchange mass, especially as one of the members expands into a red giant. Suppose that one star in a double-star system has evolved to a black hole and that the second star begins to expand. If the two stars are not too far apart, the outer layers of the expanding star may reach the point where the black hole exerts more gravitational force on them than do the inner layers of the red giant to which the atmosphere belongs. The outer atmosphere then passes through the point of no return between the stars and falls toward the black hole.</p><p id="m59944-fs-id1168048478640"><span id="m59944-fs-id1168048478640"> </span>The mutual revolution of the giant star and the black hole causes the material falling toward the black hole to spiral around it rather than flow directly into it.

In real life, Kepler&#8217;s law allows us to calculate only the combined mass of the two stars in the binary system. We must learn more about the visible star of the pair and its history to ascertain the distance to the binary pair, the true size of the visible star&#8217;s orbit, and how the orbit of the two stars is tilted toward Earth, something we can rarely measure. And neutron stars can also have accretion disks that produce X-rays, so astronomers must study the properties of these X-rays carefully when trying to determine what kind of object is at the center of the disk. Nevertheless, a number of systems that clearly contain black holes have now been found.</p></div><div class="section" id="m59944-fs-id1168048498159"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 id="m59944-fs-id1168048498159"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated"/><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t">The Discovery of Stellar-Mass Black Holes</span></h3></div></div></div><p id="m59944-fs-id1168048485753"><span id="m59944-fs-id1168048485753"> </span>Because X-rays are such important tracers of black holes that are having some of their stellar companions for lunch, the search for black holes had to await the launch of sophisticated X-ray telescopes into space.

Out in the suburban regions of the Milky Way Galaxy where we live (see <a class="link target-chapter" href="ch25.html#m59947" title="25..&#160;Thinking Ahead">The Milky Way Galaxy</a>), stars and star systems are much too far apart for other stars to provide &#8220;food&#8221; to a hungry black hole.

Here, stars and raw material can be quite crowded together, and they can interact much more frequently with each other. Therefore, black holes in the centers of galaxies may have a much better opportunity to find mass close enough to their event horizons to pull in. Black holes are not particular about what they &#8220;eat&#8221;: they are happy to consume other stars, asteroids, gas, dust, and even other black holes. (If two black holes merge, you just get a black hole with more mass and a larger event horizon.)</p><p id="m59944-fs-id1168048697895"><span id="m59944-fs-id1168048697895"> </span>As a result, black holes in crowded regions can grow, eventually swallowing thousands or even millions of times the mass of the Sun. Ground-based observations have provided compelling evidence that there is a black hole in the center of our own Galaxy with a mass of about 4 million times the mass of the Sun (we&#8217;ll discuss this further in the chapter on <a class="link target-chapter" href="ch25.html#m59947" title="25..&#160;Thinking Ahead">The Milky Way Galaxy</a>). Observations with the Hubble Space Telescope have shown dramatic evidence for the existence of black holes in the centers of many other galaxies. These black holes can contain more than a billion solar masses. The feeding frenzy of such supermassive black holes may be responsible for some of the most energetic phenomena in the universe (see <a class="link target-chapter" href="ch27.html#m59961" title="27..&#160;Thinking Ahead">Active Galaxies, Quasars, and Supermassive Black Holes</a>). And evidence from more recent X-ray observations is also starting to indicate the existence of &#8220;middle-weight&#8221; black holes, whose masses are dozens to thousands of times the mass of the Sun. The crowded inner regions of the globular clusters we described in <a class="link target-chapter" href="ch22.html#m59924" title="22..&#160;Thinking Ahead">Stars from Adolescence to Old Age</a> may be just the right breeding grounds for such intermediate-mass black holes.</p><p id="m59944-fs-id1168046109324"><span id="m59944-fs-id1168046109324"> </span>Over the past decades, many observations, especially with the Hubble Space Telescope and with X-ray satellites, have been made that can be explained only if black holes really do exist. Furthermore, the observational tests of Einstein&#8217;s general theory of relativity have convinced even the most skeptical scientists that his picture of warped or curved spacetime is indeed our best description of the effects of gravity near these black holes.</p></div></div><div xml:lang="en" class="section module" id="m59945"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 id="m59945"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated"/><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-n">24.7</span><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated">.&#160;</span><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t">Gravitational Wave Astronomy<sup><a href="co03.html#book-attribution-m59945">*</a></sup></span></h2></div><div class="abstract"><div class="title"><span><span class="cnx-gentext-abstract cnx-gentext-autogenerated"/><span class="cnx-gentext-abstract cnx-gentext-t"/></span></div><p/></div></div></div><div class="toc"><ul><li class="toc-section learning-objectives"><a href="#m59945-fs-id1168047666359" class="target-section"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t">Learning Objectives</span></a></li><li class="toc-section"><a href="#m59945-fs-id1168047709734" class="target-section"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t">Proof from a Pulsar</span></a></li><li class="toc-section"><a href="#m59945-fs-id1168047374142" class="target-section"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t">Direct Observations</span></a></li></ul></div><div class="section learning-objectives" id="m59945-fs-id1168047666359"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 id="m59945-fs-id1168047666359"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated"/><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t">Learning Objectives</span></h3></div></div></div><p id="m59945-fs-id1168584530982"><span id="m59945-fs-id1168584530982"> </span>By the end of this section, you will be able to:</p><div class="itemizedlist" id="m59945-fs-id1168047843896"><span id="m59945-fs-id1168047843896"> </span><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p>Describe what a gravitational wave is, what can produce it, and how fast it propagates</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Understand the basic mechanisms used to detect gravitational waves</p></li></ul></div></div><p id="m59945-fs-id1168047214576"><span id="m59945-fs-id1168047214576"> </span>Another part of Einstein&#8217;s ideas about gravity can be tested as a way of checking the theory that underlies black holes.

If this is correct, then the orbital period should decrease (according to Kepler&#8217;s third law) by one ten-millionth of a second per orbit. Continuing observations showed that the period is decreasing by precisely this amount. Such a loss of energy in the system can be due only to the radiation of gravitational waves, thus confirming their existence.

Once again, Einstein&#8217;s revolutionary idea is found to be the correct description of nature.</p><p id="m59945-fs-id1168047294409"><span id="m59945-fs-id1168047294409"> </span>Several facilities similar to LIGO are under construction in other countries to contribute to gravitational wave astronomy and help us pinpoint more precisely where in the sky the signals we detect come from. The European Space Agency (ESA) is also exploring the possibility of building an even larger detector for gravitational waves in space. The goal is to launch a facility called eLISA sometime in the mid 2030s. The design calls for three arms or paths, each a million kilometers in length, for the laser light to travel. This facility could detect the distant merger of supermassive black holes such as might have occurred when the first generation of stars formed only a few hundred million years after the Big Bang. In December 2015, ESA launched LISA Pathfinder to test the technology required to hold two gold-platinum cubes in a state of weightless, perfect rest relative one another. While LISA Pathfinder cannot itself detect gravitational waves, such stability will be required if eLISA is to be able to detect the small changes in path length produced by passing gravitational waves.</p><p id="m59945-fs-id1168047218340"><span id="m59945-fs-id1168047218340"> </span>We should end by acknowledging that the ideas discussed in this chapter may seem strange and overwhelming, especially the first time you read them.

For example, general relativity predicts that light or radio waves will be deflected when they pass near the Sun, and that the position where Mercury is at perihelion would change by 43 arcsec per century even if there were no other planets in the solar system to perturb its orbit.

Nothing, not even light, can escape through the event horizon from the black hole. At its center, each black hole is thought to have a singularity, a point of infinite density and zero volume. Matter falling into a black hole appears, as viewed by an outside observer, to freeze in position at the event horizon.

Later in life, he founds his own internet company and becomes very wealthy when it goes public. He sets up a foundation to support the search for black holes in our Galaxy. Your group is the allocation committee of this foundation. How would you distribute money each year to increase the chances that more black holes will be found?</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Suppose for a minute that stars evolve <span class="emphasis"><em>without</em></span> losing any mass at any stage of their lives. Your group is given a list of binary star systems. Each binary contains one main-sequence star and one invisible companion. The spectral types of the main-sequence stars range from spectral type O to M. Your job is to determine whether any of the invisible companions might be black holes. Which ones are worth observing? Why? (Hint: Remember that in a binary star system, the two stars form at the same time, but the pace of their evolution depends on the mass of each star.)</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>You live in the far future, and the members of your group have been convicted (falsely) of high treason. The method of execution is to send everyone into a black hole, but you get to pick which one. Since you are doomed to die, you would at least like to see what the inside of a black hole is like&#8212;even if you can&#8217;t tell anyone outside about it. Would you choose a black hole with a mass equal to that of Jupiter or one with a mass equal to that of an entire galaxy? Why? What would happen to you as you approached the event horizon in each case? (Hint: Consider the difference in force on your feet and your head as you cross over the event horizon.)</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>General relativity is one of the areas of modern astrophysics where we can clearly see the frontiers of human knowledge. We have begun to learn about black holes and warped spacetime recently and are humbled by how much we still don&#8217;t know. Research in this field is supported mostly by grants from government agencies. Have your group discuss what reasons there are for our tax dollars to support such &#8220;far out&#8221; (seemingly impractical) work. Can you make a list of &#8220;far out&#8221; areas of research in past centuries that later led to practical applications? What if general relativity does not have many practical applications? Do you think a small part of society&#8217;s funds should still go to exploring theories about the nature of space and time?</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Once you all have read this chapter, work with your group to come up with a plot for a science fiction story that uses the properties of black holes.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Black holes seem to be fascinating not just to astronomers but to the public, and they have become part of popular culture. Searching online, have group members research examples of black holes in music, advertising, cartoons, and the movies, and then make a presentation to share the examples you found with the whole class.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>As mentioned in the <a class="link" href="ch24.html#m59943-fs-id1168048740878" title="Gravity and Time Machines">Gravity and Time Machines</a> feature box in this chapter, the film <span class="emphasis"><em>Interstellar</em></span> has a lot of black hole science in its plot and scenery. That&#8217;s because astrophysicist Kip Thorne at Caltech had a big hand in writing the initial treatment for the movie, and later producing it. Get your group members together (be sure you have popcorn) for a viewing of the movie and then try to use your knowledge of black holes from this chapter to explain the plot. (Note that the film also uses the concept of a <span class="emphasis"><em>wormhole,</em></span> which we don&#8217;t discuss in this chapter. A wormhole is a theoretically possible way to use a large, spinning black hole to find a way to travel from one place in the universe to another without having to go through regular spacetime to get there.)</p></li></ol></div></div></div></div><!--CNX: Start Area: "Review Questions"--><div class="cnx-eoc review-questions"><div class="title"><span>Review Questions</span></div><div class="section empty"><div class="title"><a href="#m59938"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated"/><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-n">24.</span><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated">.&#160;</span><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t">Thinking Ahead</span></a></div><div class="body"/></div><div class="section empty"><div class="title"><a href="#m59939"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated"/><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-n">24.1</span><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated">.&#160;</span><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t">Introducing General Relativity</span></a></div><div class="body"/></div><div class="section empty"><div class="title"><a href="#m59940"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated"/><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-n">24.2</span><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated">.&#160;</span><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t">Spacetime and Gravity</span></a></div><div class="body"/></div><div class="section empty"><div class="title"><a href="#m59941"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated"/><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-n">24.3</span><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated">.&#160;</span><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t">Tests of General Relativity</span></a></div><div class="body"/></div><div class="section empty"><div class="title"><a href="#m59942"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated"/><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-n">24.4</span><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated">.&#160;</span><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t">Time in General Relativity</span></a></div><div class="body"/></div><div class="section empty"><div class="title"><a href="#m59943"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated"/><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-n">24.5</span><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated">.&#160;</span><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t">Black Holes</span></a></div><div class="body"/></div><div class="section empty"><div class="title"><a href="#m59944"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated"/><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-n">24.6</span><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated">.&#160;</span><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t">Evidence for Black Holes</span></a></div><div class="body"/></div><div class="section"><div class="title"><a href="#m59945"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated"/><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-n">24.7</span><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated">.&#160;</span><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t">Gravitational Wave Astronomy</span></a></div><div class="body"><div xmlns:ncx="http://www.daisy.org/z3986/2005/ncx/" id="m59945-fs-id1168047978976" class="exercise"><!--calling formal.object--><div class="title"><span><span class="cnx-gentext-exercise cnx-gentext-autogenerated">Exercise </span><span class="cnx-gentext-exercise cnx-gentext-n">1.</span></span></div><div class="body"><!--calling informal.object--><div class="problem" id="m59945-fs-id1168047651576"><span id="m59945-fs-id1168047651576"> </span>
