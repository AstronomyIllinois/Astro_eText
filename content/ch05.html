If charges are in motion, however (as they are inside every atom and in a wire carrying a current), then we measure another force called <span class="emphasis"><em>magnetism</em></span>.</p><p id="m59792-fs-id1163975290195"><span id="m59792-fs-id1163975290195"> </span>Magnetism was well known for much of recorded human history, but its cause was not understood until the nineteenth century.

Water waves require water to travel in. The sound waves we hear, to give another example, are pressure disturbances that require air to travel though. But electromagnetic waves do not require water or air: the fields generate each other and so can move through a vacuum (such as outer space). This was such a disturbing idea to nineteenth-century scientists that they actually made up a substance to fill all of space&#8212;one for which there was not a single shred of evidence&#8212;just so light waves could have something to travel through: they called it the <span class="emphasis"><em>aether</em></span>.

No matter where electromagnetic waves are generated from and no matter what other properties they have, when they are moving (and not interacting with matter), they move at the speed of light. Yet you know from everyday experience that there are different kinds of light. For example, we perceive that light waves differ from one another in a property we call color.

To see how this works, imagine a parade in which everyone is forced by prevailing traffic conditions to move at exactly the same speed. You stand on a corner and watch the waves of marchers come by. First you see row after row of miniature ponies. Because they are not very large and, therefore, have a shorter wavelength, a good number of the ponies can move past you each minute; we can say they have a high frequency. Next, however, come several rows of circus elephants. The elephants are large and marching at the same speed as the ponies, so far fewer of them can march past you per minute: Because they have a wider spacing (longer wavelength), they represent a lower frequency.</p><p id="m59792-fs-id1163975687177"><span id="m59792-fs-id1163975687177"> </span>The formula for this relationship can be expressed as follows: for any wave motion, the speed at which a wave moves equals the frequency times the wavelength.

His experiment ultimately led to the technologies of television, cell phones, and today&#8217;s wireless networks around the globe.</p><p id="m59792-fs-id1163974243340"><span id="m59792-fs-id1163974243340"> </span>However, by the beginning of the twentieth century, more sophisticated experiments had revealed that light behaves in certain ways that cannot be explained by the wave model. Reluctantly, physicists had to accept that sometimes light behaves more like a &#8220;particle&#8221;&#8212;or at least a self-contained packet of energy&#8212;than a wave. We call such a packet of electromagnetic energy a <em class="glossterm" id="m59792-autoid-cnx2dbk-idm140481019159808"><span id="m59792-autoid-cnx2dbk-idm140481019159808"> </span>photon</em><a id="idm45983376814960" class="indexterm"/>.</p><p id="m59792-fs-id1163974227414"><span id="m59792-fs-id1163974227414"> </span>The fact that light behaves like a wave in certain experiments and like a particle in others was a very surprising and unlikely idea. After all, our common sense says that waves and particles are opposite concepts. On one hand, a wave is a repeating disturbance that, by its very nature, is not in only one place, but spreads out. A particle, on the other hand, is something that can be in only one place at any given time. Strange as it sounds, though, countless experiments now confirm that electromagnetic radiation can sometimes behave like a wave and at other times like a particle.</p><p id="m59792-fs-id1163975567194"><span id="m59792-fs-id1163975567194"> </span>Then, again, perhaps we shouldn&#8217;t be surprised that something that always travels at the &#8220;speed limit&#8221; of the universe and doesn&#8217;t need a medium to travel through might not obey our everyday common sense ideas. The confusion that this wave-particle duality of light caused in physics was eventually resolved by the introduction of a more complicated theory of waves and particles, now called quantum mechanics. (This is one of the most interesting fields of modern science, but it is mostly beyond the scope of our book. If you are interested in it, see some of the suggested resources at the end of this chapter.)</p><p id="m59792-fs-id1163975372510"><span id="m59792-fs-id1163975372510"> </span>In any case, you should now be prepared when scientists (or the authors of this book) sometimes discuss electromagnetic radiation as if it consisted of waves and at other times refer to it as a stream of photons. A photon (being a packet of energy) carries a specific amount of energy. We can use the idea of energy to connect the photon and wave models. How much energy a photon has depends on its frequency when you think about it as a wave. A low-energy radio wave has a low frequency as a wave, while a high-energy X-ray at your dentist&#8217;s office is a high-frequency wave. Among the colors of visible light, violet-light photons have the highest energy and red-light photons have the lowest.</p><p id="m59792-fs-id1163974415559"><span id="m59792-fs-id1163974415559"> </span>Test whether the connection between photons and waves is clear to you. In the above example, which photon would have the longer wavelength as a wave: the radio wave or the X-ray? If you answered the radio wave, you are correct.

A solid is composed of molecules and atoms in continuous vibration: they move back and forth in place, but their motion is much too small for our eyes to make out. A gas consists of atoms and/or molecules that are flying about freely at high speed, continually bumping into one another and bombarding the surrounding matter. The hotter the solid or gas, the more rapid the motion of its molecules or atoms. The temperature of something is thus a measure of the average motion energy of the particles that make it up.</p><p id="m59798-fs-id1163973090867"><span id="m59798-fs-id1163973090867"> </span>This motion at the microscopic level is responsible for much of the electromagnetic radiation on Earth and in the universe. As atoms and molecules move about and collide, or vibrate in place, their electrons give off electromagnetic radiation. The characteristics of this radiation are determined by the temperature of those atoms and molecules. In a hot material, for example, the individual particles vibrate in place or move rapidly from collisions, so the emitted waves are, on average, more energetic. And recall that higher energy waves have a higher frequency. In very cool material, the particles have low-energy atomic and molecular motions and thus generate lower-energy waves.</p><div id="m59798-fs-id1163976543491" class="note astronomy link-to-learning"><div class="title"><span class="cnx-gentext-tip-t"/></div><div class="body"><p id="m59798-fs-id1163973078635"><span id="m59798-fs-id1163973078635"> </span>Check out the <a class="link" href="https://openstax.org/l/30elmagsp1">NASA briefing</a> or <a class="link" href="https://openstax.org/l/30elmagsp2">NASA&#8217;s 5-minute introductory video</a> to learn more about the electromagnetic spectrum.</p></div></div></div><div class="section" id="m59798-fs-id1163973212790"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 id="m59798-fs-id1163973212790"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated"/><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t">Radiation Laws</span></h3></div></div></div><p id="m59798-fs-id1163976547422"><span id="m59798-fs-id1163976547422"> </span>To understand, in more quantitative detail, the relationship between temperature and electromagnetic radiation, we imagine an idealized object called a <em class="glossterm" id="m59798-autoid-cnx2dbk-idm140480998433392"><span id="m59798-autoid-cnx2dbk-idm140480998433392"> </span>blackbody</em><a id="idm45983376545280" class="indexterm"/>.

This is because in any solid or denser gas, some molecules or atoms vibrate or move between collisions slower than average and some move faster than average. So when we look at the electromagnetic waves emitted, we find a broad range, or spectrum, of energies and wavelengths. More energy is emitted at the average vibration or motion rate (the highest part of each curve), but if we have a large number of atoms or molecules, some energy will be detected at each wavelength.</p><p id="m59798-fs-id1163973474827"><span id="m59798-fs-id1163973474827"> </span>Second, note that an object at a higher temperature emits more power at all wavelengths than does a cooler one.

In the real world of stars, this means that hotter stars give off more energy at every wavelength than do cooler stars.</p><p id="m59798-fs-id1163973217224"><span id="m59798-fs-id1163973217224"> </span>Third, the graph shows us that the higher the temperature, the shorter the wavelength at which the maximum power is emitted. Remember that a shorter wavelength means a higher frequency and energy. It makes sense, then, that hot objects give off a larger fraction of their energy at shorter wavelengths (higher energies) than do cool objects. You may have observed examples of this rule in everyday life. When a burner on an electric stove is turned on low, it emits only heat, which is infrared radiation, but does not glow with visible light. If the burner is set to a higher temperature, it starts to glow a dull red. At a still-higher setting, it glows a brighter orange-red (shorter wavelength). At even higher temperatures, which cannot be reached with ordinary stoves, metal can appear brilliant yellow or even blue-white.</p><p id="m59798-fs-id1163973116313"><span id="m59798-fs-id1163973116313"> </span>We can use these ideas to come up with a rough sort of &#8220;thermometer&#8221; for measuring the temperatures of stars. Because many stars give off most of their energy in visible light, the color of light that dominates a star&#8217;s appearance is a rough indicator of its temperature. If one star looks red and another looks blue, which one has the higher temperature? Because blue is the shorter-wavelength color, it is the sign of a hotter star. (Note that the temperatures we associate with different colors in science are not the same as the ones artists use. In art, red is often called a &#8220;hot&#8221; color and blue a &#8220;cool&#8221; color. Likewise, we commonly see red on faucet or air conditioning controls to indicate hot temperatures and blue to indicate cold temperatures. Although these are common uses to us in daily life, in nature, it&#8217;s the other way around.)</p><p id="m59798-fs-id1163973498699"><span id="m59798-fs-id1163973498699"> </span>We can develop a more precise star thermometer by measuring how much energy a star gives off at each wavelength and by constructing diagrams like <a class="xref target-figure" href="ch05.html#m59798-OSC_Astro_05_02_Illustrate" title="Figure&#160;5.8.&#160;Radiation Laws Illustrated.">Figure&#160;5.8</a>.

If the spectrum of the white light from the Sun and stars were simply a continuous rainbow of colors, astronomers would have little interest in the detailed study of a star&#8217;s spectrum once they had learned its average surface temperature. In 1802, however, William Wollaston built an improved spectrometer that included a lens to focus the Sun&#8217;s spectrum on a screen. With this device, Wollaston saw that the colors were not spread out uniformly, but instead, some ranges of color were missing, appearing as dark bands in the solar spectrum. He mistakenly attributed these lines to natural boundaries between the colors.

If the gas in a container consisted of two elements, then light passing through it was missing the colors (showing dark lines) for both of the elements. So it became clear that certain lines in the spectrum &#8220;go with&#8221; certain elements.

No two types of atoms or molecules give the same patterns. In other words, each particular gas can absorb or emit only certain wavelengths of the light peculiar to that gas. In contrast, absorption spectra occur when passing white light through a cool, thin gas. The temperature and other conditions determine whether the lines are bright or dark (whether light is absorbed or emitted), but the wavelengths of the lines for any element are the same in either case. It is the precise pattern of wavelengths that makes the signature of each element unique. Liquids and solids can also generate spectral lines or bands, but they are broader and less well defined&#8212;and hence, more difficult to interpret. Spectral analysis, however, can be quite useful.

This outer atmosphere is not all that different from the rest of the Sun, just thinner and cooler.

Maxwell&#8217;s theory of electromagnetic radiation says that when electrons change either speed or the direction of motion, they must emit energy. Orbiting electrons constantly change their direction of motion, so they should emit a constant stream of energy. Applying Maxwell&#8217;s theory to Rutherford&#8217;s model, all electrons should spiral into the nucleus of the atom as they lose energy, and this collapse should happen very quickly&#8212;in about 10<sup>&#8211;16</sup> seconds.</p><p id="m59794-fs-id1163975705857"><span id="m59794-fs-id1163975705857"> </span>It was Danish physicist Niels <em class="glossterm no-emphasis" id="m59794-autoid-cnx2dbk-idm140481018829104"><span id="m59794-autoid-cnx2dbk-idm140481018829104"> </span>Bohr</em><a id="idm45983375844304" class="indexterm"/> (1885&#8211;1962) who solved the mystery of how electrons remain in orbit. He was trying to develop a model of the atom that would also explain certain regularities observed in the spectrum of hydrogen. He suggested that the spectrum of hydrogen can be understood if we assume that orbits of only certain sizes are possible for the electron. Bohr further assumed that as long as the electron moves in only one of these allowed orbits, it radiates no energy: its energy would change only if it moved from one orbit to another.</p><p id="m59794-fs-id1163975391436"><span id="m59794-fs-id1163975391436"> </span>This suggestion, in the words of science historian Abraham Pais, was &#8220;one of the most audacious hypotheses ever introduced in physics.&#8221; If something equivalent were at work in the everyday world, you might find that, as you went for a walk after astronomy class, nature permitted you to walk two steps per minute, five steps per minute, and 12 steps per minute, but no speeds in between. No matter how you tried to move your legs, only certain walking speeds would be permitted. To make things more bizarre, it would take no effort to walk at any one of the allowed speeds, but it would be difficult to change from one speed to another. Luckily, no such rules apply at the level of human behavior. But at the microscopic level of the atom, experiment after experiment has confirmed the validity of Bohr&#8217;s strange idea. Bohr&#8217;s suggestions became one of the foundations of the new (and much more sophisticated) model of the subatomic world called quantum mechanics.</p><p id="m59794-fs-id1163974175080"><span id="m59794-fs-id1163974175080"> </span>In Bohr&#8217;s model, if the electron moves from one orbit to another closer to the atomic nucleus, it must give up some energy in the form of electromagnetic radiation.

In the Sun, for example, we find that most of the hydrogen and helium atoms in its atmosphere are neutral, whereas most of the calcium atoms, as well as many other heavier atoms, are ionized once.</p><p id="m59795-fs-id1163975658253"><span id="m59795-fs-id1163975658253"> </span>The energy levels of an ionized atom are entirely different from those of the same atom when it is neutral. Each time an electron is removed from the atom, the energy levels of the ion, and thus the wavelengths of the spectral lines it can produce, change. This helps astronomers differentiate the ions of a given element. Ionized hydrogen, having no electron, can produce no absorption lines.</p></div></div><div xml:lang="en" class="section module" id="m59799"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 id="m59799"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated"/><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-n">5.6</span><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated">.&#160;</span><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t">The Doppler Effect<sup><a href="co03.html#book-attribution-m59799">*</a></sup></span></h2></div><div class="abstract"><div class="title"><span><span class="cnx-gentext-abstract cnx-gentext-autogenerated"/><span class="cnx-gentext-abstract cnx-gentext-t"/></span></div><p/></div></div></div><div class="toc"><ul><li class="toc-section learning-objectives"><a href="#m59799-fs-id1163974280445" class="target-section"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t">Learning Objectives</span></a></li><li class="toc-section"><a href="#m59799-fs-id1163974263930" class="target-section"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t">Motion Affects Waves</span></a></li><li class="toc-section"><a href="#m59799-fs-id1163975656676" class="target-section"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t">Color Shifts</span></a></li></ul></div><div class="section learning-objectives" id="m59799-fs-id1163974280445"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 id="m59799-fs-id1163974280445"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated"/><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t">Learning Objectives</span></h3></div></div></div><p id="m59799-fs-id1168583400437"><span id="m59799-fs-id1168583400437"> </span>By the end of this section, you will be able to:</p><div class="itemizedlist" id="m59799-fs-id1163975574006"><span id="m59799-fs-id1163975574006"> </span><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p>Explain why the spectral lines of photons we observe from an object will change as a result of the object&#8217;s motion toward or away from us</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Describe how we can use the Doppler effect to deduce how fast astronomical objects are moving through space</p></li></ul></div></div><p id="m59799-fs-id1163975575671"><span id="m59799-fs-id1163975575671"> </span>The last two sections introduced you to many new concepts, and we hope that through those, you have seen one major idea emerge.

The emission of electromagnetic radiation is intimately connected to the temperature of the source. The higher the temperature of an idealized emitter of electromagnetic radiation, the shorter is the wavelength at which the maximum amount of radiation is emitted.

All atoms except hydrogen can also contain one or more neutrons in the nucleus. Negatively charged electrons orbit the nucleus. The number of protons defines an element (hydrogen has one proton, helium has two, and so on) of the atom. Nuclei with the same number of protons but different numbers of neutrons are different isotopes of the same element. In the Bohr model of the atom, electrons on permitted orbits (or energy levels) don&#8217;t give off any electromagnetic radiation. But when electrons go from lower levels to higher ones, they must absorb a photon of just the right energy, and when they go from higher levels to lower ones, they give off a photon of just the right energy.

Since each atom has its own characteristic set of energy levels, each is associated with a unique pattern of spectral lines. This allows astronomers to determine what elements are present in the stars and in the clouds of gas and dust among the stars. An atom in its lowest energy level is in the ground state. If an electron is in an orbit other than the least energetic one possible, the atom is said to be excited. If an atom has lost one or more electrons, it is called an ion and is said to be ionized.

A greenhouse gas blocks the transmission of infrared light. Given that the incoming light to Earth is sunlight with a characteristic temperature of 5800 K (which peaks in the visible part of the spectrum) and the outgoing light from Earth has a characteristic temperature of about 300 K (which peaks in the infrared part of the spectrum), explain how greenhouse gases cause Earth to warm up. As part of your answer, discuss that greenhouse gases block both incoming and outgoing infrared light. Explain why these two effects don&#8217;t simply cancel each other, leading to no net temperature change.</p>
