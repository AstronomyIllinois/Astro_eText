In contrast, the larger terrestrial planets&#8212;Earth, Venus, and Mars&#8212;are more active and interesting worlds. We have already discussed Earth, and we now turn to Venus and Mars. These are the nearest planets and the most accessible to spacecraft. Not surprisingly, the greatest effort in planetary exploration has been devoted to these fascinating worlds. In the chapter, we discuss some of the results of more than four decades of scientific exploration of Mars and Venus. Mars is exceptionally interesting, with evidence that points to habitable conditions in the past. Even today, we are discovering things about Mars that make it the most likely place where humans might set up a habitat in the future. However, our robot explorers have clearly shown that neither Venus nor Mars has conditions similar to Earth.

The canal markings were always difficult to study, glimpsed only occasionally because atmospheric conditions caused the tiny image of Mars to shimmer in the telescope. Lowell saw canals everywhere (even a few on Venus), but many other observers could not see them at all and remained unconvinced of their existence. When telescopes larger than Lowell&#8217;s failed to confirm the presence of canals, the skeptics felt vindicated. Now it is generally accepted that the straight lines were an optical illusion, the result of the human mind&#8217;s tendency to see order in random features that are glimpsed dimly at the limits of the eye&#8217;s resolution. When we see small, dim dots of surface markings, our minds tend to connect those dots into straight lines.</p><div id="m59845-fs-id1168048373241" class="note astronony voyagers-in-astronomy"><div class="title"><span class="cnx-gentext-tip-t">Percival Lowell: Dreaming of an Inhabited Mars</span></div><div class="body"><p id="m59845-fs-id1168048359862"><span id="m59845-fs-id1168048359862"> </span>Percival <em class="glossterm no-emphasis" id="m59845-autoid-cnx2dbk-idm140481014103808"><span id="m59845-autoid-cnx2dbk-idm140481014103808"> </span>Lowell</em><a id="idm45983370196896" class="indexterm"/> was born into the well-to-do Massachusetts family about whom John Bossidy made the famous toast:</p><div class="blockquote" id="m59845-fs-id1168048351911"><span id="m59845-fs-id1168048351911"> </span><blockquote class="blockquote"><p id="m59845-fs-id1168048258812">And this is good old Boston,<!--cnx.newline--><br/>

His undergraduate thesis at Harvard dealt with the origin of the solar system, but he did not pursue this interest immediately. Instead, he entered the family business and traveled extensively in Asia.

In 1930, Pluto was found at the Lowell Observatory, and it is not a coincidence that the name selected for the new planet starts with Lowell&#8217;s initials.

This high precision is not obtained by watching Mars for a single rotation, but by noting how many turns it makes over a long period of time. Good observations of Mars date back more than 200 years, a period during which tens of thousands of martian days have passed. As a result, the rotation period can be calculated to within a few hundredths of a second.</p><p id="m59845-fs-id1168048299780"><span id="m59845-fs-id1168048299780"> </span>The rotational axis of Mars has a tilt of about 25&#176;, similar to the tilt of Earth&#8217;s axis. Thus, Mars experiences seasons very much like those on Earth. Because of the longer martian year (almost two Earth years), however, each season there lasts about six of our months.</p><p id="m59845-fs-id1168048338980"><span id="m59845-fs-id1168048338980"> </span>The situation with <em class="glossterm no-emphasis" id="m59845-autoid-cnx2dbk-idm140481015832448"><span id="m59845-autoid-cnx2dbk-idm140481015832448"> </span>Venus</em><a id="idm45983370157744" class="indexterm"/> is different. Since no surface detail can be seen through Venus&#8217; clouds, its rotation period can be found only by bouncing radar signals off the planet (as explained for Mercury in the <a class="link target-chapter" href="ch09.html#m59830" title="9..&#160;Thinking Ahead">Cratered Worlds</a> chapter). The first radar observations of Venus&#8217; rotation were made in the early 1960s. Later, topographical surface features were identified on the planet that showed up in the reflected radar signals. The rotation period of Venus, precisely determined from the motion of such &#8220;radar features&#8221; across its disk, is 243 days. Even more surprising than how <span class="emphasis"><em>long</em></span> Venus takes to rotate is the fact that it spins in a backward or retrograde direction (east to west).</p><p id="m59845-fs-id1168048321990"><span id="m59845-fs-id1168048321990"> </span>Stop for a moment and think about how odd this slow rotation makes the calendar on Venus. The planet takes 225 Earth days to orbit the Sun and 243 Earth days to spin on its axis. So the day on Venus (as defined by its spinning once) is longer than the year! As a result, the time the Sun takes to return to the same place in Venus&#8217; sky&#8212;another way we might define the meaning of a day&#8212;turns out to be 117 Earth days. (If you say &#8220;See you tomorrow&#8221; on Venus, you&#8217;ll have a long time to wait.) Although we do not know the reason for Venus&#8217; slow backward rotation, we can guess that it may have suffered one or more extremely powerful collisions during the formation process of the solar system.</p></div><div class="section" id="m59845-fs-id1168048243522"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 id="m59845-fs-id1168048243522"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated"/><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t">Basic Properties of Venus and Mars</span></h3></div></div></div><p id="m59845-fs-id1168048335370"><span id="m59845-fs-id1168048335370"> </span>Before discussing each planet individually, let us compare some of their basic properties with each other and with Earth (<a class="xref target-table" href="ch10.html#m59845-fs-id1168048335165" title="Table&#160;10.1.&#160;">Table&#160;10.1</a>). <em class="glossterm no-emphasis" id="m59845-autoid-cnx2dbk-idm140481015825568"><span id="m59845-autoid-cnx2dbk-idm140481015825568"> </span>Venus</em><a id="idm45983370146976" class="indexterm"/> is in many ways Earth&#8217;s twin, with a mass 0.82 times the mass of Earth and an almost identical density. The average amount of geological activity has been also relatively high, almost as high as on Earth. On the other hand, with a surface pressure nearly 100 times greater than ours, Venus&#8217; atmosphere is not at all like that of Earth. The surface of Venus is also remarkably hot, with a temperature of 730 K (over 850 &#176;F), hotter than the self-cleaning cycle of your oven. One of the major challenges presented by Venus is to understand why the atmosphere and surface environment of this twin have diverged so sharply from those of our own planet.</p><div class="table span-all" id="m59845-fs-id1168048335165"><table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" summary="This table contains four columns and eleven rows.

Crater statistics show very few craters less than 10 kilometers in diameter, indicating that projectiles smaller than about 1 kilometer (the size that typically produces a 10-kilometer crater) were stopped by the atmosphere. Those craters with diameters from 10 to 30 kilometers are frequently distorted or multiple, apparently because the incoming projectile broke apart in the atmosphere before it could strike the ground as shown in the Stein crater in <a class="xref target-figure" href="ch10.html#m59838-OSC_Astro_10_02_Craters" title="Figure&#160;10.7.&#160;Impact Craters on Venus.">Figure&#160;10.7</a>.

How can our neighbor planet be so hot? Although Venus is somewhat closer to the Sun than is Earth, its surface is hundreds of degrees hotter than you would expect from the extra sunlight it receives. Scientists wondered what could be heating the surface of Venus to a temperature above 700 K. The answer turned out to be the <span class="emphasis"><em>greenhouse effect</em></span>.</p><p id="m59840-fs-id1168047660245"><span id="m59840-fs-id1168047660245"> </span>The greenhouse effect works on Venus just as it does on Earth, but since Venus has so much more CO<sub>2</sub>&#8212;almost a million times more&#8212;the effect is much stronger. The thick CO<sub>2</sub> acts as a blanket, making it very difficult for the infrared (heat) radiation from the ground to get back into space. As a result, the surface heats up. The energy balance is only restored when the planet is radiating as much energy as it receives from the Sun, but this can happen only when the temperature of the lower atmosphere is very high. One way of thinking of greenhouse heating is that it must raise the surface temperature of Venus until this energy balance is achieved.</p><p id="m59840-fs-id1168047330760"><span id="m59840-fs-id1168047330760"> </span>Has Venus always had such a massive atmosphere and high surface temperature, or might it have evolved to such conditions from a climate that was once more nearly earthlike? The answer to this question is of particular interest to us as we look at the increasing levels of CO<sub>2</sub> in Earth&#8217;s atmosphere. As the greenhouse effect becomes stronger on Earth, are we in any danger of transforming our own planet into a hellish place like Venus?</p><p id="m59840-fs-id1168047780666"><span id="m59840-fs-id1168047780666"> </span>Let us try to reconstruct the possible evolution of Venus from an earthlike beginning to its present state. Venus may once have had a climate similar to that of Earth, with moderate temperatures, water oceans, and much of its CO<sub>2</sub> dissolved in the ocean or chemically combined with the surface rocks. Then we allow for modest additional heating&#8212;by gradual increase in the energy output of the Sun, for example. When we calculate how Venus&#8217; atmosphere would respond to such effects, it turns out that even a small amount of extra heat can lead to increased evaporation of water from the oceans and the release of gas from surface rocks.</p><p id="m59840-fs-id1168047639965"><span id="m59840-fs-id1168047639965"> </span>This in turn means a further increase in the atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> and H<sub>2</sub>O, gases that would amplify the <em class="glossterm no-emphasis" id="m59840-autoid-cnx2dbk-idm140481035689680"><span id="m59840-autoid-cnx2dbk-idm140481035689680"> </span>greenhouse effect</em><a id="idm45983369883056" class="indexterm"/> in Venus&#8217; atmosphere.

Unless some other processes intervene, the temperature thus continues to rise.

The atmosphere evolves from having a small greenhouse effect, such as on Earth, to a situation where greenhouse warming is a major factor, as we see today on Venus. Once the large greenhouse conditions develop, the planet establishes a new, much hotter equilibrium near its surface.</p><p id="m59840-fs-id1168047582176"><span id="m59840-fs-id1168047582176"> </span>Reversing the situation is difficult because of the role water plays. On Earth, most of the CO<sub>2</sub> is either chemically bound in the rocks of our crust or dissolved by the water in our oceans. As Venus got hotter and hotter, its oceans evaporated, eliminating that safety valve. But the water vapor in the planet&#8217;s atmosphere will not last forever in the presence of ultraviolet light from the Sun. The light element hydrogen can escape from the atmosphere, leaving the oxygen behind to combine chemically with surface rock. The loss of water is therefore an irreversible process: once the water is gone, it cannot be restored.

The first visitor was the US Mariner 4, which flew past Mars in 1965 and transmitted 22 photos to Earth. These pictures showed an apparently bleak planet with abundant impact craters. In those days, craters were unexpected; some people who were romantically inclined still hoped to see canals or something like them.

Two <span class="emphasis"><em>orbiters</em></span> surveyed the planet and served to relay communications for two <span class="emphasis"><em>landers</em></span> on the surface. After an exciting and sometimes frustrating search for a safe landing spot, the Viking 1 lander touched down on the surface of Chryse Planitia (the Plains of Gold) on July 20, 1976, exactly 7 years after Neil Armstrong&#8217;s historic first step on the Moon. Two months later, Viking 2 landed with equal success in another plain farther north, called Utopia. The landers photographed the surface with high resolution and carried out complex experiments searching for evidence of life, while the orbiters provided a global perspective on Mars geology.</p><p id="m59843-fs-id1168048593846"><span id="m59843-fs-id1168048593846"> </span>Mars languished unvisited for two decades after Viking.

An orbiter called <span class="emphasis"><em>Mars Global Surveyor</em></span> (MGS) arrived a few months later and began high-resolution photography of the entire surface over more than one martian year. The most dramatic discovery by this spacecraft, which is still operating, was evidence of gullies apparently cut by surface water, as we will discuss later. These missions were followed in 2003 by the NASA <span class="emphasis"><em>Mars Odyssey</em></span> orbiter, and the ESA <span class="emphasis"><em>Mars Express</em></span> orbiter, both carrying high-resolution cameras. A gamma-ray spectrometer on <span class="emphasis"><em>Odyssey</em></span> discovered a large amount of subsurface hydrogen (probably in the form of frozen water). Subsequent orbiters included the NASA <span class="emphasis"><em>Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter</em></span> to evaluate future landing sites, MAVEN to study the upper atmosphere, and India&#8217;s <span class="emphasis"><em>Mangalayaan</em></span>, also focused on study of Mars&#8217; thin layers of air.

Many impacts have occurred on the red planet, as shown by its heavily cratered surface. Fragments blasted from large impacts can escape from Mars, whose surface gravity is only 38% of Earth&#8217;s. A long time later (typically a few million years), a very small fraction of these fragments collide with Earth and survive their passage through our atmosphere, just like other meteorites.

Part of the problem is the low temperatures on the planet. But even if the temperature on a sunny summer day rises above the freezing point, the low pressure means that liquid water still cannot exist on the surface, except at the lowest elevations. At a pressure of less than 0.006 bar, the boiling point is as low or lower than the freezing point, and water changes directly from solid to vapor without an intermediate liquid state (as does &#8220;dry ice,&#8221; carbon dioxide, on Earth). However, salts dissolved in water lower its freezing point, as we know from the way salt is used to thaw roads after snow and ice forms during winter on Earth. Salty water is therefore sometimes able to exist in liquid form on the martian surface, under the right conditions.</p><p id="m59856-fs-id1168047821388"><span id="m59856-fs-id1168047821388"> </span>Several types of clouds can form in the martian atmosphere.

Immediately released by NASA, the new images showed a low mesa-like hill cut crossways by several roughly linear ridges and depressions, which were misidentified in the 1976 photo as the eyes and mouth of a face.

Some have even suggested that future technology might allow us to <span class="emphasis"><em>terraform</em></span> Mars&#8212;that is, to engineer its atmosphere and climate in ways that might make the planet more hospitable for long-term human habitation.</p></div><div class="section" id="m59856-fs-id1168047722694"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 id="m59856-fs-id1168047722694"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated"/><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t">The Search for Life on Mars</span></h3></div></div></div><p id="m59856-fs-id1168047316542"><span id="m59856-fs-id1168047316542"> </span>If there was running water on Mars in the past, perhaps there was life as well. Could life, in some form, remain in the martian soil today? Testing this possibility, however unlikely, was one of the primary objectives of the Viking landers in 1976. These landers carried miniature biological laboratories to test for microorganisms in the martian soil. Martian soil was scooped up by the spacecraft&#8217;s long arm and placed into the experimental chambers, where it was isolated and incubated in contact with a variety of gases, radioactive isotopes, and nutrients to see what would happen. The experiments looked for evidence of <span class="emphasis"><em>respiration</em></span> by living animals, <span class="emphasis"><em>absorption</em></span> of <span class="emphasis"><em>nutrients</em></span> offered to organisms that might be present, and an <span class="emphasis"><em>exchange of gases</em></span> between the soil and its surroundings for any reason whatsoever. A fourth instrument pulverized the soil and analyzed it carefully to determine what organic (carbon-bearing) material it contained.</p><p id="m59856-fs-id1168047385538"><span id="m59856-fs-id1168047385538"> </span>The Viking experiments were so sensitive that, had one of the spacecraft landed anywhere on Earth (with the possible exception of Antarctica), it would easily have detected life. But, to the disappointment of many scientists and members of the public, no life was detected on Mars. The soil tests for absorption of nutrients and gas exchange did show some activity, but this was most likely caused by chemical reactions that began as water was added to the soil and had nothing to do with life. In fact, these experiments showed that martian soil seems much more chemically active than terrestrial soils because of its exposure to solar ultraviolet radiation (since Mars has no ozone layer).</p><p id="m59856-fs-id1168047535044"><span id="m59856-fs-id1168047535044"> </span>The organic chemistry experiment showed no trace of organic material, which is apparently destroyed on the martian surface by the sterilizing effect of this ultraviolet light. While the possibility of life on the surface has not been eliminated, most experts consider it negligible. Although Mars has the most earthlike environment of any planet in the solar system, the sad fact is that nobody seems to be home today, at least on the surface.</p><p id="m59856-fs-id1168047700625"><span id="m59856-fs-id1168047700625"> </span>However, there is no reason to think that life could not have begun on Mars about 4 billion years ago, at the same time it started on Earth. The two planets had very similar surface conditions then. Thus, the attention of scientists has shifted to the search for <span class="emphasis"><em>fossil</em></span> life on Mars. One of the primary questions to be addressed by future spacecraft is whether Mars once supported its own life forms and, if so, how this martian life compared with that on our own planet. Future missions will include the return of martian samples selected from sedimentary rocks at sites that once held water and thus perhaps ancient life. The most powerful searches for martian life (past or present) will thus be carried out in our laboratories here on Earth.</p><div id="m59856-fs-id1168047377717" class="note astronomy making-connections"><div class="title"><span class="cnx-gentext-tip-t">Planetary Protection</span></div><div class="body"><p id="m59856-fs-id1168047338133"><span id="m59856-fs-id1168047338133"> </span>When scientists begin to search for life on another planet, they must make sure that we do not contaminate the other world with life carried from Earth. At the very beginning of spacecraft exploration on Mars, an international agreement specified that all landers were to be carefully sterilized to avoid accidentally transplanting terrestrial microbes to Mars. In the case of Viking, we know the sterilization was successful. Viking&#8217;s failure to detect martian organisms also implies that these experiments did not detect hitchhiking terrestrial microbes.</p><p id="m59856-fs-id1168047349759"><span id="m59856-fs-id1168047349759"> </span>As we have learned more about the harsh conditions on the martian surface, the sterilization requirements have been somewhat relaxed. It is evident that no terrestrial microbes could grow on the martian surface, with its low temperature, absence of water, and intense ultraviolet radiation. Microbes from Earth might survive in a dormant, dried state, but they cannot grow and proliferate on Mars.</p><p id="m59856-fs-id1168047217340"><span id="m59856-fs-id1168047217340"> </span>The problem of contaminating Mars will become more serious, however, as we begin to search for life below the surface, where temperatures are higher and no ultraviolet light penetrates. The situation will be even more daunting if we consider human flights to Mars. Any humans will carry with them a multitude of terrestrial microbes of all kinds, and it is hard to imagine how we can effectively keep the two biospheres isolated from each other if Mars has indigenous life. Perhaps the best situation could be one in which the two life-forms are so different that each is effectively invisible to the other&#8212;not recognized on a chemical level as living or as potential food.</p><p id="m59856-fs-id1168047794922"><span id="m59856-fs-id1168047794922"> </span>The most immediate issue of public concern is not with the contamination of Mars but with any dangers associated with returning Mars samples to Earth. NASA is committed to the complete biological isolation of returned samples until they are demonstrated to be safe. Even though the chances of contamination are extremely low, it is better to be safe than sorry.</p><p id="m59856-fs-id1168047354803"><span id="m59856-fs-id1168047354803"> </span>Most likely there is no danger, even if there is life on Mars and alien microbes hitch a ride to Earth inside some of the returned samples. In fact, Mars is sending samples to Earth all the time in the form of the Mars meteorites. Since some of these microbes (if they exist) could probably survive the trip to Earth inside their rocky home, we may have been exposed many times over to martian microbes. Either they do not interact with our terrestrial life, or in effect our planet has already been inoculated against such alien bugs.</p></div></div><div id="m59856-fs-id1168047989663" class="note astronomy link-to-learning"><div class="title"><span class="cnx-gentext-tip-t"/></div><div class="body"><p id="m59856-fs-id1168047910987"><span id="m59856-fs-id1168047910987"> </span>More than any other planet, Mars has inspired science fiction writers over the years.

Evidence of a very different climate in the past is found in water erosion features: both runoff channels and outflow channels, the latter carved by catastrophic floods. Our rovers, exploring ancient lakebeds and places where sedimentary rock has formed, have found evidence for extensive surface water in the past. Even more exciting are the gullies that seem to show the presence of flowing salty water on the surface today, hinting at near-surface aquifers.
