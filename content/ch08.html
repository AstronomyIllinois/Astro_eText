Just as the sound frequencies vary depending on the material the bell is made of and how it is constructed, so a planet<sup>&#8217;</sup>s response depends on its composition and structure. By monitoring the seismic waves in different locations, scientists can learn about the layers through which the waves have traveled. Some of these vibrations travel along the surface; others pass directly through the interior. Seismic studies have shown that Earth&#8217;s interior consists of several distinct layers with different compositions, illustrated in <a class="xref target-figure" href="ch08.html#m59825-OSC_Astro_08_01_Interior" title="Figure&#160;8.3.&#160;Interior Structure of Earth.">Figure&#160;8.3</a>.

He studied at the universities in Heidelberg, Innsbruck, and Berlin, receiving a doctorate in astronomy by reexamining thirteenth-century astronomical tables. But, his interests turned more and more toward Earth, particularly its weather. He carried out experiments using kites and balloons, becoming so accomplished that he and his brother set a world record in 1906 by flying for 52 hours in a balloon.</p><p id="m59826-fs-id1170326095787"><span id="m59826-fs-id1170326095787"> </span>Wegener first conceived of continental drift in 1910 while examining a world map in an atlas, but it took 2 years for him to assemble sufficient data to propose the idea in public. He published the results in book form in 1915. Wegener&#8217;s evidence went far beyond the congruence in the shapes of the continents. He proposed that the similarities between fossils found only in South America and Africa indicated that these two continents were joined at one time. He also showed that resemblances among living animal species on different continents could best be explained by assuming that the continents were once connected in a supercontinent he called <span class="emphasis"><em>Pangaea</em></span> (from Greek elements meaning &#8220;all land&#8221;).</p><p id="m59826-fs-id1170326223028"><span id="m59826-fs-id1170326223028"> </span>Wegener&#8217;s suggestion was met with a hostile reaction from most scientists. Although he had marshaled an impressive list of arguments for his hypothesis, he was missing a <span class="emphasis"><em>mechanism</em></span>. No one could explain <span class="emphasis"><em>how</em></span> solid continents could drift over thousands of miles. A few scientists were sufficiently impressed by Wegener&#8217;s work to continue searching for additional evidence, but many found the notion of moving continents too revolutionary to take seriously. Developing an understanding of the mechanism (plate tectonics) would take decades of further progress in geology, oceanography, and geophysics.</p><p id="m59826-fs-id1170326054527"><span id="m59826-fs-id1170326054527"> </span>Wegener was disappointed in the reception of his suggestion, but he continued his research and, in 1924, he was appointed to a special meteorology and geophysics professorship created especially for him at the University of Graz (where he was, however, ostracized by most of the geology faculty). Four years later, on his fourth expedition to his beloved Greenland, he celebrated his fiftieth birthday with colleagues and then set off on foot toward a different camp on the island. He never made it; he was found a few days later, dead of an apparent heart attack.</p><p id="m59826-fs-id1170326418648"><span id="m59826-fs-id1170326418648"> </span>Critics of science often point to the resistance to the continental drift hypothesis as an example of the flawed way that scientists regard new ideas. (Many people who have advanced crackpot theories have claimed that they are being ridiculed unjustly, just as Wegener was.) But we think there is a more positive light in which to view the story of Wegener&#8217;s suggestion. Scientists in his day maintained a skeptical attitude because they needed more evidence and a clear mechanism that would fit what they understood about nature. Once the evidence and the mechanism were clear, Wegener&#8217;s hypothesis quickly became the centerpiece of our view of a dynamic Earth.</p></div></div><div id="m59826-fs-id1170326423663" class="note astronomy link-to-learning"><div class="title"><span class="cnx-gentext-tip-t"/></div><div class="body"><p id="m59826-fs-id1170323818193"><span id="m59826-fs-id1170323818193"> </span>See how the <a class="link" href="https://openstax.org/l/30contintdrift">drift of the continents</a> has changed the appearance of our planet&#8217;s crust.</p></div></div></div><div class="section" id="m59826-fs-id1170326021333"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 id="m59826-fs-id1170326021333"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated"/><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t">Rift and Subduction Zones</span></h3></div></div></div><p id="m59826-fs-id1170326111382"><span id="m59826-fs-id1170326111382"> </span>Plates pull apart from each other along <em class="glossterm" id="m59826-autoid-cnx2dbk-idm140480999245712"><span id="m59826-autoid-cnx2dbk-idm140480999245712"> </span>rift zones</em><a id="idm45983372027696" class="indexterm"/>, such as the Mid-Atlantic ridge, driven by upwelling currents in the mantle (<a class="xref target-figure" href="ch08.html#m59826-OSC_Astro_08_02_RiftZone" title="Figure&#160;8.9.&#160;Rift Zone and Subduction Zone.">Figure&#160;8.9</a>).

About 60,000 kilometers of active rifts have been identified, with average separation rates of about 4 centimeters per year. The new area added to Earth each year is about 2 square kilometers, enough to renew the entire oceanic crust in a little more than 100 million years.

In general, the thick continental masses cannot be subducted, but the thinner oceanic plates can be rather readily thrust down into the upper mantle. Often a subduction zone is marked by an ocean trench; a fine example of this type of feature is the deep Japan trench along the coast of Asia. The subducted plate is forced down into regions of high pressure and temperature, eventually melting several hundred kilometers below the surface. Its material is recycled into a downward-flowing convection current, ultimately balancing the flow of material that rises along rift zones.

Similar lava plains are found on the Moon and the other terrestrial planets.</p></div></div><div xml:lang="en" class="section module" id="m59827"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 id="m59827"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated"/><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-n">8.3</span><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated">.&#160;</span><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t">Earth&#8217;s Atmosphere<sup><a href="co03.html#book-attribution-m59827">*</a></sup></span></h2></div><div class="abstract"><div class="title"><span><span class="cnx-gentext-abstract cnx-gentext-autogenerated"/><span class="cnx-gentext-abstract cnx-gentext-t"/></span></div><p/></div></div></div><div class="toc"><ul><li class="toc-section learning-objectives"><a href="#m59827-fs-id1170326565359" class="target-section"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t">Learning Objectives</span></a></li><li class="toc-section"><a href="#m59827-fs-id1170326324374" class="target-section"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t">Structure of the Atmosphere</span></a></li><li class="toc-section"><a href="#m59827-fs-id1170326097882" class="target-section"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t">Atmospheric Composition and Origin</span></a></li><li class="toc-section"><a href="#m59827-fs-id1170326042790" class="target-section"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t">Weather and Climate</span></a></li></ul></div><div class="section learning-objectives" id="m59827-fs-id1170326565359"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 id="m59827-fs-id1170326565359"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated"/><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t">Learning Objectives</span></h3></div></div></div><p id="m59827-fs-id1168583547281"><span id="m59827-fs-id1168583547281"> </span>By the end of this section, you will be able to:</p><div class="itemizedlist" id="m59827-fs-id1170326327376"><span id="m59827-fs-id1170326327376"> </span><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p>Differentiate between Earth&#8217;s various atmospheric layers</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Describe the chemical composition and possible origins of our atmosphere</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Explain the difference between weather and climate</p></li></ul></div></div><p id="m59827-fs-id1170321713682"><span id="m59827-fs-id1170321713682"> </span>We live at the bottom of the ocean of air that envelops our planet.

The breakup of ozone adds heat to the stratosphere, reversing the decreasing temperature trend in the troposphere. Because ozone is essential to our survival, we reacted with justifiable concern to evidence that became clear in the 1980s that atmospheric ozone was being destroyed by human activities. By international agreement, the production of industrial chemicals that cause ozone depletion, called chlorofluorocarbons, or CFCs, has been phased out.

Slowly, however, the increasing evolutionary sophistication of life led to a growth in the plant population and thus increased oxygen production.

To maintain an energy balance, the temperature of the surface and lower atmosphere must increase until the total energy radiated by Earth to space equals the energy received from the Sun.

It was these environmental effects, rather than the explosion itself, that were responsible for the mass extinction, including the demise of the dinosaurs.</p></div><div class="section" id="m59829-fs-id1170326274532"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 id="m59829-fs-id1170326274532"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated"/><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t">Impacts and the Evolution of Life</span></h3></div></div></div><p id="m59829-fs-id1170326280700"><span id="m59829-fs-id1170326280700"> </span>It is becoming clear that many&#8212;perhaps most&#8212;mass extinctions in Earth&#8217;s long history resulted from a variety of other causes, but in the case of the dinosaur killer, the cosmic impact certainly played a critical role and may have been the &#8220;final straw&#8221; in a series of climactic disturbances that resulted in the &#8220;great dying.&#8221;</p><p id="m59829-fs-id1170326277290"><span id="m59829-fs-id1170326277290"> </span>A catastrophe for one group of living things, however, may create opportunities for another group. Following each mass extinction, there is a sudden evolutionary burst as new species develop to fill the ecological niches opened by the event. Sixty-five million years ago, our ancestors, the mammals, began to thrive when so many other species died out. We are the lucky beneficiaries of this process.</p><p id="m59829-fs-id1170326144808"><span id="m59829-fs-id1170326144808"> </span>Impacts by comets and asteroids represent the only mechanisms we know of that could cause truly global catastrophes and seriously influence the evolution of life all over the planet. As paleontologist Stephen Jay Gould of Harvard noted, such a perspective changes fundamentally our view of biological evolution. The central issues for the survival of a species must now include more than just its success in competing with other species and adapting to slowly changing environments, as envisioned by Darwin&#8217;s idea of natural selection. Also required is an ability to survive random global catastrophes due to impacts.</p><p id="m59829-fs-id1170324010753"><span id="m59829-fs-id1170324010753"> </span>Still earlier in its history, Earth was subject to even larger impacts from the leftover debris of planet formation. We know that the Moon was struck repeatedly by objects larger than 100 kilometers in diameter&#8212;1000 times more massive than the object that wiped out most terrestrial life 65 million years ago. Earth must have experienced similar large impacts during its first 700 million years of existence. Some of them were probably violent enough to strip the planet of most its atmosphere and to boil away its oceans. Such events would sterilize the planet, destroying any life that had begun. Life may have formed and been wiped out several times before our own microbial ancestors took hold sometime about 4 billion years ago.</p><p id="m59829-fs-id1170326097483"><span id="m59829-fs-id1170326097483"> </span>The fact that the oldest surviving microbes on Earth are thermophiles (adapted to very high temperatures) can also be explained by such large impacts. An impact that was just a bit too small to sterilize the planet would still have destroyed anything that lived in what we consider &#8220;normal&#8221; environments, and only the creatures adapted to high temperatures would survive. Thus, the oldest surviving terrestrial lifeforms are probably the remnants of a sort of evolutionary bottleneck caused by repeated large impacts early in the planet&#8217;s history.</p></div><div class="section" id="m59829-fs-id1170326243289"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 id="m59829-fs-id1170326243289"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated"/><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t">Impacts in Our Future?</span></h3></div></div></div><p id="m59829-fs-id1170326332553"><span id="m59829-fs-id1170326332553"> </span>The impacts by asteroids and comets that have had such a major influence on life are not necessarily a thing of the past. In the full scope of planetary history, 65 million years ago was just yesterday. Earth actually orbits the Sun within a sort of cosmic shooting gallery, and although major impacts are rare, they are by no means over. Humanity could suffer the same fate as the dinosaurs, or lose a city to the much more frequent impacts like the one over Tunguska, unless we figure out a way to predict the next big impact and to protect our planet. The fact that our solar system is home to some very large planets in outer orbits may be beneficial to us; the gravitational fields of those planets can be very effective at pulling in cosmic debris and shielding us from larger, more frequent impacts.</p><p id="m59829-fs-id1170326130545"><span id="m59829-fs-id1170326130545"> </span>Beginning in the 1990s, a few astronomers began to analyze the cosmic impact hazard and to persuade the government to support a search for potentially hazardous asteroids. Several small but sophisticated wide-field telescopes are now used for this search, which is called the NASA Spaceguard Survey. Already we know that there are currently no asteroids on a collision course with Earth that are as big (10&#8211;15 kilometers) as the one that killed the dinosaurs. The Spaceguard Survey now concentrates on finding smaller potential impactors. By 2015, the search had netted more than 15,000 near-Earth-asteroids, including most of those larger than 1 kilometer. None of those discovered so far poses any danger to us. Of course, we cannot make a similar statement about the asteroids that have not yet been discovered, but these will be found and evaluated one by one for their potential hazard. These asteroid surveys are one of the few really life-and-death projects carried out by astronomers, with a potential to help to save our planet from future major impacts.</p><div id="m59829-fs-id1170326143131" class="note astronomy link-to-learning"><div class="title"><span class="cnx-gentext-tip-t"/></div><div class="body"><p id="m59829-fs-id1170326111382"><span id="m59829-fs-id1170326111382"> </span>The <a class="link" href="https://openstax.org/l/30torhazscale">Torino Impact Hazard Scale</a> is a method for categorizing the impact hazard associated with near-Earth objects such as asteroids and comets.

Today, astronomers are working to predict the next impact in advance, while other scientists are coming to grips with the effect of impacts on the evolution and diversity of life on Earth.</p></div></div></div><!--CNX: Start Area: "For Further Exploration"--><div class="cnx-eoc further-exploration"><div class="title"><span>For Further Exploration</span></div><div class="section empty"><div class="title"><a href="#m59824"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated"/><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-n">8.</span><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated">.&#160;</span><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t">Thinking Ahead</span></a></div><div class="body"/></div><div class="section empty"><div class="title"><a href="#m59825"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated"/><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-n">8.1</span><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated">.&#160;</span><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t">The Global Perspective</span></a></div><div class="body"/></div><div class="section empty"><div class="title"><a href="#m59826"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated"/><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-n">8.2</span><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated">.&#160;</span><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t">Earth&#8217;s Crust</span></a></div><div class="body"/></div><div class="section empty"><div class="title"><a href="#m59827"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated"/><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-n">8.3</span><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated">.&#160;</span><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t">Earth&#8217;s Atmosphere</span></a></div><div class="body"/></div><div class="section empty"><div class="title"><a href="#m59828"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated"/><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-n">8.4</span><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated">.&#160;</span><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t">Life, Chemical Evolution, and Climate Change</span></a></div><div class="body"/></div><div class="section"><div class="title"><a href="#m59829"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated"/><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-n">8.5</span><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated">.&#160;</span><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t">Cosmic Influences on the Evolution of Earth</span></a></div><div class="body"><div class="section" id="m59829-fs-id1170326066854"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 id="m59829-fs-id1170326066854"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated"/><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t">Articles</span></h4></div></div></div><div class="section" id="m59829-fs-id1170326451131"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h5 id="m59829-fs-id1170326451131"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated"/><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t"><span class="emphasis"><em>Earth</em></span></span></h5></div></div></div><p id="m59829-fs-id1170326487963"><span id="m59829-fs-id1170326487963"> </span>Collins, W., et al. &#8220;The Physical Science behind Climate Change.&#8221; <span class="emphasis"><em>Scientific American</em></span> (August 2007): 64.
