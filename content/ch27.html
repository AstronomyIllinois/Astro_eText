The discovery of radio sources that appeared point-like, just like stars, came with the use of surplus World War II radar equipment in the 1950s. Although few astronomers would have predicted it, the sky turned out to be full of strong sources of radio waves. As they improved the images that their new radio telescopes could make, scientists discovered that some radio sources were in the same location as faint blue &#8220;stars.&#8221; No known type of star in our Galaxy emits such powerful radio radiation.

But the lines in 3C 273 were shifted far to the red of the wavelengths at which the Balmer lines are normally located. Indeed, these lines were at such long wavelengths that if the redshifts were attributed to the Doppler effect, 3C 273 was receding from us at a speed of 45,000 kilometers per second, or about 15% the speed of light!

Their astounding speeds showed that the radio &#8220;stars&#8221; could not possibly be stars in our own Galaxy. Any true star moving at more than a few hundred kilometers per second would be able to overcome the gravitational pull of the Galaxy and completely escape from it.

If they did not obey the rule that large redshift means large distance, then they could be much closer, and their luminosity could be a lot less. One straightforward way to show that quasars had to obey the Hubble law was to demonstrate that they were actually part of galaxies, and that their redshift was the same as the galaxy that hosted them.

Hints that this is true had been obtained with ground-based telescopes, but space observations were required to make a convincing case. The reason is that quasars can outshine their entire galaxies by factors of 10 to 100 or even more. When this light passes through Earth&#8217;s atmosphere, it is blurred by turbulence and drowns out the faint light from the surrounding galaxy&#8212;much as the bright headlights from an oncoming car at night make it difficult to see anything close by.</p><p id="m59962-fs-id1163974354862"><span id="m59962-fs-id1163974354862"> </span>The Hubble Space Telescope, however, is not affected by atmospheric turbulence and can detect the faint glow from some of the galaxies that host quasars (<a class="xref target-figure" href="ch27.html#m59962-OSC_Astro_27_01_Host" title="Figure&#160;27.5.&#160;Quasar Host Galaxies.">Figure&#160;27.5</a>). Quasars have been found in the cores of both spiral and elliptical galaxies, and each quasar has the same redshift as its host galaxy. A wide range of studies with the Hubble Space Telescope now clearly demonstrate that quasars are indeed far away. If so, they must be producing a truly impressive amount of energy to be detectable as points of light that are much brighter than their galaxy. Interestingly, many quasar host galaxies are found to be involved in a collision with a second galaxy, providing, as we shall see, an important clue to the source of their prodigious energy output.</p><div id="m59962-OSC_Astro_27_01_Host" class="figure"><div class="body"><div class="mediaobject" id="m59962-fs-id1163974300957"><span id="m59962-fs-id1163974300957"> </span><img src="m59962/OSC_Astro_27_01_Host.jpg" alt="Quasar Host Galaxies.

In visible light alone, most are far more energetic than the brightest elliptical galaxies. But, as we saw, quasars also emit energy at X-ray and ultraviolet wavelengths, and some are radio sources as well. When all their radiation is added together, some QSOs have total luminosities as large as a hundred trillion Suns (10<sup>14</sup> <span class="emphasis"><em>L</em></span><sub>Sun</sub>), which is 10 to 100 times the brightness of luminous elliptical galaxies.</p><p id="m59962-fs-id1163974288385"><span id="m59962-fs-id1163974288385"> </span>Finding a mechanism to produce the large amount of energy emitted by a quasar would be difficult under any circumstances. But there is an additional problem. When astronomers began monitoring quasars carefully, they found that some vary in luminosity on time scales of months, weeks, or even, in some cases, days. This variation is irregular and can change the brightness of a quasar by a few tens of percent in both its visible light and radio output.</p><p id="m59962-fs-id1163974171922"><span id="m59962-fs-id1163974171922"> </span>Think about what such a change in luminosity means. A quasar at its dimmest is still more brilliant than any normal galaxy. Now imagine that the brightness increases by 30% in a few weeks. Whatever mechanism is responsible must be able to release new energy at rates that stagger our imaginations. The most dramatic changes in quasar brightness are equivalent to the energy released by 100,000 billion Suns. To produce this much energy we would have to convert the total mass of about ten Earths into energy every minute.</p><p id="m59962-fs-id1163975483595"><span id="m59962-fs-id1163975483595"> </span>Moreover, because the fluctuations occur in such short times, the part of a quasar that is varying must be smaller than the distance light travels in the time it takes the variation to occur&#8212;typically a few months. To see why this must be so, let&#8217;s consider a cluster of stars 10 light-years in diameter at a very large distance from Earth (see <a class="xref target-figure" href="ch27.html#m59962-OSC_Astro_27_01_Limitation" title="Figure&#160;27.6.&#160;How the Size of a Source Affects the Timescale of Its Variability.">Figure&#160;27.6</a>, in which Earth is off to the right). Suppose every star in this cluster somehow brightens simultaneously and remains bright. When the light from this event arrives at Earth, we would first see the brighter light from stars on the near side; 5 years later we would see increased light from stars at the center.

From Earth we would see the cluster get brighter and brighter, as light from more and more stars began to reach us. Not until 10 years after the brightening began would we see the cluster reach maximum brightness. In other words, if an extended object suddenly flares up, it will seem to brighten over a period of time equal to the time it takes light to travel across the object from its far side.</p><p id="m59962-fs-id1163975567422"><span id="m59962-fs-id1163975567422"> </span>We can apply this idea to brightness changes in quasars to estimate their diameters. Because quasars typically vary (get brighter and dimmer) over periods of a few months, the region where the energy is generated can be no larger than a few light-months across.

Pluto, usually the outermost (dwarf) planet in our solar system, is about 5.5 light-hours from us, while the nearest star is 4 light-years away. Clearly a region a few light months across is tiny relative to the size of the entire Galaxy. And some quasars vary even more rapidly, which means their energy is generated in an even smaller region. Whatever mechanism powers the quasars must be able to generate more energy than that produced by an entire galaxy in a volume of space that, in some cases, is not much larger than our solar system.</p></div><div class="section" id="m59962-fs-id1163975435196"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 id="m59962-fs-id1163975435196"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated"/><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t">Earlier Evidence</span></h3></div></div></div><p id="m59962-fs-id1163974535238"><span id="m59962-fs-id1163974535238"> </span>Even before the discovery of quasars, there had been hints that something very strange was going on in the centers of at least some galaxies.

As we shall see later in this chapter, the jet, which is several thousand light-years long, originates in a disk of superheated gas swirling around a giant black hole at the center of M87. The light that we see is produced by electrons twisting along magnetic field lines in the jet, a process known as synchrotron radiation, which gives the jet its bluish tint.

Back when astronomers first began trying to figure out what powered quasars, black holes were simply one of the more exotic predictions of the general theory of relativity that still waited to be connected to the real world.</p><p id="m59965-fs-id1163974169328"><span id="m59965-fs-id1163974169328"> </span>It was only as proof of the existence of black holes accumulated over several decades that it became clearer that only <em class="glossterm no-emphasis" id="m59965-autoid-cnx2dbk-idm140480993256032"><span id="m59965-autoid-cnx2dbk-idm140480993256032"> </span>supermassive black hole</em><a id="idm45983349560784" class="indexterm"/>s could account for all the observed properties of quasars and AGNs.

While our black hole doesn&#8217;t have the mass or energy of the quasar black holes, the mechanism that powers them is similar. The evidence now shows that most&#8212;and probably all&#8212;elliptical galaxies and all spirals with nuclear bulges have black holes at their centers. The amount of energy emitted by material near the black hole depends on two things: the mass of the black hole and the amount of matter that is falling into it.</p><p id="m59965-fs-id1163975465461"><span id="m59965-fs-id1163975465461"> </span>If a black hole with a billion Suns&#8217; worth of mass inside (10<sup>9</sup> <span class="emphasis"><em>M</em></span><sub>Sun</sub>) accretes (gathers) even a relatively modest amount of additional material&#8212;say, about 10 <span class="emphasis"><em>M</em></span><sub>Sun</sub> per year&#8212;then (as we shall see) it can, in the process, produce as much energy as a thousand normal galaxies.

Without large quantities of fresh &#8220;food,&#8221; the surroundings of black holes glow only weakly as bits of local material spiral inward toward the black hole. So somehow large amounts of gas have to find their way to the black hole from the galaxy in order to feed the quasar and make it grow and give off the energy to be noticed. Where does this &#8220;food&#8221; for the black hole come from originally and how might it be replenished? The jury is still out, but the options are pretty clear.</p><p id="m59966-fs-id1163976553917"><span id="m59966-fs-id1163976553917"> </span>One obvious source of fuel for the black hole is matter from the host galaxy itself. Galaxies start out with large amounts of interstellar gas and dust, and at least some of this interstellar matter is gradually converted into stars as the galaxy evolves. On the other hand, as stars go through their lives and die, they lose mass all the time into the space between them, thereby returning some of the gas and dust to the interstellar medium. We expect to find more gas and dust in the central regions early in a galaxy&#8217;s life than later on, when much of it has been converted into stars. Any of the interstellar matter that ventures too close to the black hole may be accreted by it. This means that we would expect that the number and luminosity of quasars powered in this way would decline with time. And as we have seen, that is just what we find.</p><p id="m59966-fs-id1163976891637"><span id="m59966-fs-id1163976891637"> </span>Today both <span class="emphasis"><em>elliptical galaxies</em></span> and the <span class="emphasis"><em>nuclear bulges</em></span> <span class="emphasis"><em>of</em></span> <span class="emphasis"><em>spiral galaxies</em></span> have very little raw material left to serve as a source of fuel for the black hole.

The black hole in turn can also influence the galaxy in which it resides. It can do so in three ways: through its jets, through winds of particles that manage to stream away from the accretion disk, and through radiation from the accretion disk. As they stream away from the black hole, all three can either promote star formation by compressing the surrounding gas and dust&#8212;or instead suppress star formation by heating the surrounding gas and shredding molecular clouds, thereby inhibiting or preventing star formation. The outflowing energy can even be enough to halt the accretion of new material and starve the black hole of fuel.

Observations show that they existed when the universe was very young. One dramatic example is the discovery of a quasar that was already shining when the universe was only 700 million years old. What does it take to create a large black hole so quickly? A related problem is that in order to eventually build black holes containing more than 2 billion solar masses, it is necessary to have giant &#8220;seed&#8221; black holes with masses at least 2000 times the mass of the Sun&#8212;and they must somehow have been created shortly after the expansion of the universe began.</p><p id="m59966-fs-id1163973199022"><span id="m59966-fs-id1163973199022"> </span>Astronomers are now working actively to develop models for how these seed black holes might have formed. Theories suggest that galaxies formed from collapsing clouds of dark matter and gas. Some of the gas formed stars, but perhaps some of the gas settled to the center where it became so concentrated that it formed a black hole. If this happened, the black hole could form right away&#8212;although this requires that the gas should not be rotating very much initially.</p><p id="m59966-fs-id1163976878847"><span id="m59966-fs-id1163976878847"> </span>A more likely scenario is that the gas will have some angular momentum (rotation) that will prevent direct collapse to a black hole. In that case, the very first generation of stars will form, and some of them, according to calculations, will have masses hundreds of times that of the Sun. When these stars finish burning hydrogen, just a few million years later, the supernovae they end with will create black holes a hundred or so times the mass of the Sun. These can then merge with others or accrete the rich gas supply available at these early times.</p><p id="m59966-fs-id1163976427428"><span id="m59966-fs-id1163976427428"> </span>The challenge is growing these smaller black holes quickly enough to make the much larger black holes we see a few hundred million years later. It turns out to be difficult because there are limits on how fast they can accrete matter. These should make sense to you from what we discussed earlier in the chapter. If the rate of accretion becomes too high, then the energy streaming outward from the black hole&#8217;s accretion disk will become so strong as to blow away the infalling matter.</p><p id="m59966-fs-id1163976857281"><span id="m59966-fs-id1163976857281"> </span>What if, instead, a collapsing gas cloud doesn&#8217;t form a black hole directly or break up and form a group of regular stars, but stays together and makes one fairly massive star embedded within a dense cluster of thousands of lower mass stars and large quantities of dense gas? The massive star will have a short lifetime and will soon collapse to become a black hole. It can then begin to attract the dense gas surrounding it. But calculations show that the gravitational attraction of the many nearby stars will cause the black hole to zigzag randomly within the cluster and will prevent the formation of an accretion disk.

Their visible-light spectra at first seemed confusing, but then astronomers realized that they had much larger redshifts than stars. The quasar spectra obtained so far show redshifts ranging from 15% to more than 96% the speed of light. Observations with the Hubble Space Telescope show that quasars lie at the centers of galaxies and that both spirals and ellipticals can harbor quasars. The redshifts of the underlying galaxies match the redshifts of the quasars embedded in their centers, thereby proving that quasars obey the Hubble law and are at the great distances implied by their redshifts. To be noticeable at such great distances, quasars must have 10 to 100 times the luminosity of the brighter normal galaxies. Their variations show that this tremendous energy output is generated in a small volume&#8212;in some cases, in a region not much larger than our own solar system. A number of galaxies closer to us also show strong activity at their centers&#8212;activity now known to be caused by the same mechanism as the quasars.</p></div></div><div class="section"><div class="title"><a href="#m59965"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated"/><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-n">27.2</span><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated">.&#160;</span><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t">Supermassive Black Holes: What Quasars Really Are</span></a></div><div class="body"><p id="m59965-fs-id1163974388604"><span id="m59965-fs-id1163974388604"> </span>Both active galactic nuclei and quasars derive their energy from material falling toward, and forming a hot accretion disk around, a massive black hole.

At that point, he was denied observing time by the committee of astronomers who reviewed such proposals. Suppose your group had been the committee. What decision would you have made? Why?

You can show why this is true. Suppose, for example, that the region in which the energy is generated is a transparent sphere 1 light-year in diameter. Suppose that in 1 s this region brightens by a factor of 10 and remains bright for two years, after which it returns to its original luminosity. Draw its light curve (a graph of its brightness over time) as viewed from Earth.</p>

In the case of NGC 4261, this chapter supplied the result of the calculation of the mass of the black hole in NGC 4261. In order to get this answer, astronomers had to measure the velocity of particles in the ring of dust and gas that surrounds the black hole. How high were these velocities? Turn Kepler&#8217;s third law around and use the information given in this chapter about the galaxy NGC 4261&#8212;the mass of the black hole at its center and the diameter of the surrounding ring of dust and gas&#8212;to calculate how long it would take a dust particle in the ring to complete a single orbit around the black hole. Assume that the only force acting on the dust particle is the gravitational force exerted by the black hole. Calculate the velocity of the dust particle in km/s.</p>
