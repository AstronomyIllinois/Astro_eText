The bright blue stars of the cluster have blown a bubble in the gas cloud. The remains of this cloud can be seen in the lower right part of the frame, glowing in response to the starlight illuminating it. In its darker parts, shielded from the harsh light of NGC 3603, new stars continue to form. Although the stars of NGC 3603 formed only recently, the most massive of them are already dying and ejecting their mass, producing the blue ring and streak features visible in the upper left part of the image. Thus, this image shows the full life cycle of stars, from formation out of interstellar gas, through life on the main sequence, to death and the return of stellar matter to interstellar space.

It also turns out that stars eject mass throughout their lives (a kind of wind blows from their surface layers) and that material must go somewhere.

When the electrons in the mercury atoms return to lower-energy levels, some of the energy they emit is in the form of ultraviolet photons. These, in turn, strike a phosphor-coated screen on the inner wall of the light tube. The atoms in the screen absorb the ultraviolet photons and emit visible light as they cascade downward among the energy levels.

Since both stars are moving in a binary system, lines that showed no motion puzzled astronomers. The lines were also peculiar in that they were much, much narrower than the rest of the lines, indicating that the gas producing them was at a very low pressure.

The discovery of this ultra-hot interstellar gas was a big surprise. Before the launch of astronomical observatories into space, which could see radiation in the ultraviolet and X-ray parts of the spectrum, astronomers assumed that most of the region between stars was filled with hydrogen at temperatures no warmer than those found in H II regions. But telescopes launched above Earth&#8217;s atmosphere obtained ultraviolet spectra that contained interstellar lines produced by oxygen atoms that have been ionized five times. To strip five electrons from their orbits around an oxygen nucleus requires a lot of energy. Subsequent observations with orbiting X-ray telescopes revealed that the Galaxy is filled with numerous bubbles of X-ray-emitting gas. To emit X-rays, and to contain oxygen atoms that have been ionized five times, gas must be heated to temperatures of a million degrees or more.</p><p id="m59910-fs-id1168048594331"><span id="m59910-fs-id1168048594331"> </span>Theorists have now shown that the source of energy producing these remarkable temperatures is the explosion of massive stars at the ends of their lives (<a class="xref target-figure" href="ch20.html#m59910-OSC_Astro_20_02_Supernova" title="Figure&#160;20.7.&#160;Vela Supernova Remnant.">Figure&#160;20.7</a>).

In retrospect, however, the presence of molecules is not surprising. As we will discuss further in the next section, and have already seen above, interstellar space also contains significant amounts of dust capable of blocking out starlight. When this dust accumulates in a single location, the result is a dark cloud where ultraviolet starlight is blocked and molecules can survive. The largest of these structures are created where gravity pulls interstellar gas together to form giant <em class="glossterm" id="m59910-autoid-cnx2dbk-idm140481045059280"><span id="m59910-autoid-cnx2dbk-idm140481045059280"> </span>molecular clouds</em><a id="idm45983357746032" class="indexterm"/>, structures as massive as a million times the mass of the Sun.

Because of their high density, molecular clouds block ultraviolet starlight, the main agent for heating most interstellar gas. As a result, they tend to be extremely cold, with typical temperatures near 10 K (&#8722;263 &#176;C).

Carbon monoxide is particularly abundant in interstellar space and is the primary tool that astronomers use to study giant molecular clouds. Unfortunately, the most abundant molecule, H<sub>2</sub>, is particularly difficult to observe directly because in most giant molecular clouds, it is too cold to emit even at radio wavelengths.

The Sun appears much redder at sunset than it does at noon. The lower the Sun is in the sky, the longer the path its light must travel through the atmosphere. Over this greater distance, there is a greater chance that sunlight will be scattered. Since red light is less likely to be scattered than blue light, the Sun appears more and more red as it approaches the horizon.</p><p id="m59911-fs-id1168047699988"><span id="m59911-fs-id1168047699988"> </span>By the way, scattering of sunlight is also what causes our sky to look blue, even though the gases that make up Earth&#8217;s atmosphere are transparent. As sunlight comes in, it scatters from the molecules of air. The small size of the molecules means that the blue colors scatter much more efficiently than the greens, yellows, and reds. Thus, the blue in sunlight is scattered out of the beam and all over the sky. The light from the Sun that comes to your eye, on the other hand, is missing some of its blue, so the Sun looks a bit yellower, even when it is high in the sky, than it would from space.</p><p id="m59911-fs-id1168047720773"><span id="m59911-fs-id1168047720773"> </span>The fact that starlight is reddened by interstellar dust means that long-wavelength radiation is transmitted through the Galaxy more efficiently than short-wavelength radiation. Consequently, if we wish to see farther in a direction with considerable interstellar material, we should look at long wavelengths. This simple fact provides one of the motivations for the development of infrared astronomy. In the infrared region at 2 microns (2000 nanometers), for example, the obscuration is only one-sixth as great as in the visible region (500 nanometers), and we can therefore study stars that are more than twice as distant before their light is blocked by interstellar dust.

Why couldn&#8217;t it be the interstellar <span class="emphasis"><em>gas</em></span> that reddens distant stars and not the dust? We already know from everyday experience that atomic or molecular gas is almost transparent. Consider Earth&#8217;s atmosphere. Despite its very high density compared with that of interstellar gas, it is so transparent as to be practically invisible. (Gas does have a few specific spectral lines, but they absorb only a tiny fraction of the light as it passes through.)The quantity of <span class="emphasis"><em>gas</em></span> required to produce the observed absorption of light in interstellar space would have to be enormous. The gravitational attraction of so great a mass of gas would affect the motions of stars in ways that could easily be detected. Such motions are not observed, and thus, the interstellar absorption cannot be the result of gases.</p><p id="m59911-fs-id1168047342944"><span id="m59911-fs-id1168047342944"> </span>Although gas does not absorb much light, we know from everyday experience that tiny solid or liquid particles can be very efficient absorbers. Water vapor in the air is quite invisible. When some of that vapor condenses into tiny water droplets, however, the resulting cloud is opaque. Dust storms, smoke, and smog offer familiar examples of the efficiency with which solid particles absorb light. On the basis of arguments like these, astronomers have concluded that widely scattered <span class="emphasis"><em>solid</em></span> particles in interstellar space must be responsible for the observed dimming of starlight.

The paths of cosmic rays are curved both by magnetic fields in interstellar space and by Earth&#8217;s own field. Calculations show that low-energy cosmic rays may spiral many times around Earth before entering the atmosphere where we can detect them. If an airplane circles an airport many times before landing, it is difficult for an observer to determine the direction from which it originated.

Such cosmic rays move so rapidly that they are not significantly influenced by interstellar magnetic fields, and thus, they could escape our Galaxy.

At speeds near the speed of light, it takes perhaps 3&#8211;10 million years for the average cosmic ray to travel this distance.

The material ejected by the explosion produces a shock wave, which travels through the interstellar medium. Charged particles can become trapped, bouncing back and forth across the front of the shock wave many times. With each pass through the shock, the magnetic fields inside it accelerate the particles more and more. Eventually, they are traveling at close to the speed of light and can escape from the shock to become cosmic rays. Some collapsed stars (including star remnants left over from supernova explosions) may, under the right circumstances, also serve as accelerators of particles. In any case, we again find that the raw material of the Galaxy is enriched by the life cycle of stars. In the next section, we will look at this enrichment process in more detail.</p><div id="m59912-fs-id1168047972929" class="note astronomy link-to-learning"><div class="title"><span class="cnx-gentext-tip-t"/></div><div class="body"><p id="m59912-fs-id1168047916613"><span id="m59912-fs-id1168047916613"> </span>You can watch a <a class="link" href="https://openstax.org/l/30CALETvid">brief video about the Calorimetric Electron Telescope (CALET)</a> mission, a cosmic ray detector at the International Space Station.

This process locks interstellar matter into stars. As the stars age, evolve, and eventually die, massive stars lose a large fraction of their mass, and low-mass stars lose very little. On average, roughly one-third of the matter incorporated into stars goes back into interstellar space. Supernova explosions have so much energy that they can drive interstellar mass out of the Galaxy and back into intergalactic space. Thus, the total amount of mass of the interstellar medium is set by a competition between the gain of mass from intergalactic space, the conversion of interstellar mass into stars, and the loss of interstellar mass back into intergalactic space due to supernovae.

Instead, these components of the interstellar medium were made inside stars in the Milky Way, which returned them to the interstellar medium at the end of their lives. We will talk more about this process in later chapters, but for now just bear in mind what we learned in <a class="link target-chapter" href="ch16.html#m59880" title="16..&#160;Thinking Ahead">The Sun: A Nuclear Powerhouse</a>. What stars &#8220;do for a living&#8221; is fuse heavier elements from lighter ones, producing energy in the process.

Dust forms when grains can condense in regions where gas is dense and cool. One place where the right conditions are found is the winds from luminous cool stars (the red giants and supergiants we discussed in <a class="link target-chapter" href="ch18.html#m59897" title="18..&#160;Thinking Ahead">The Stars: A Celestial Census</a>).

In these environments, grains can stick together or gather additional atoms from the gas around them, growing larger. They also facilitate the production of other compounds, including some of the more complex molecules we discussed earlier.</p><p id="m59913-fs-id1168048517727"><span id="m59913-fs-id1168048517727"> </span>The surfaces of the dust grains (see <a class="link target-chapter" href="ch20.html#m59911" title="20.3.&#160;Cosmic Dust">Cosmic Dust</a>)&#8212;which would seem very large if you were an atom&#8212;provide &#8220;nooks and crannies&#8221; where these atoms can stick long enough to find partners and form molecules. (Think of the dust grains as &#8220;interstellar social clubs&#8221; where lonely atoms can meet and form meaningful relationships.) Eventually, the dust grains become coated with ices. The presence of the dust shields the molecules inside the clouds from ultraviolet radiation and cosmic rays that would break them up.</p><p id="m59913-fs-id1168048563041"><span id="m59913-fs-id1168048563041"> </span>When stars finally begin to form within the cloud, they heat the grains and evaporate the ices. The gravitational attraction of the newly forming stars also increases the density of the surrounding cloud material. Many more chemical reactions take place on the surfaces of grains in the gas surrounding the newly forming stars, and these areas are where organic molecules are formed. These molecules can be incorporated into newly formed planetary systems, and the early Earth may have been seeded in just such a way.</p><p id="m59913-fs-id1168046047950"><span id="m59913-fs-id1168046047950"> </span>Indeed, scientists speculate that some of the water on Earth may have come from interstellar grains. Recent observations from space have shown that water is abundant in dense interstellar clouds. Since stars are formed from this material, water must be present when solar systems, including our own, come into existence. The water in our oceans and lakes may have come initially from water locked into the rocky material that accreted to form Earth. Alternatively, the water may have been brought to Earth when asteroids and comets (formed from the same cloud that made the planets) later impacted it. Scientists estimate that one comet impact every thousand years during Earth&#8217;s first billion years would have been enough to account for the water we see today. Of course, both sources may have contributed to the water we now enjoy drinking and swimming in.</p><p id="m59913-fs-id1168048311623"><span id="m59913-fs-id1168048311623"> </span>Any interstellar grains that are incorporated into newly forming stars (instead of the colder planets and smaller bodies around them) will be destroyed by their high temperatures. But eventually, each new generation of stars will evolve to become red giants, with stellar winds of their own. Some of these stars will also become supernovae and explode. Thus, the process of recycling cosmic material can start all over again.</p></div></div><div xml:lang="en" class="section module" id="m59914"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 id="m59914"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated"/><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-n">20.6</span><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated">.&#160;</span><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t">Interstellar Matter around the Sun<sup><a href="co03.html#book-attribution-m59914">*</a></sup></span></h2></div><div class="abstract"><div class="title"><span><span class="cnx-gentext-abstract cnx-gentext-autogenerated"/><span class="cnx-gentext-abstract cnx-gentext-t"/></span></div><p/></div></div></div><div class="toc"><ul><li class="toc-section learning-objectives"><a href="#m59914-fs-id1168047959925" class="target-section"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t">Learning Objectives</span></a></li></ul></div><div class="section learning-objectives" id="m59914-fs-id1168047959925"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 id="m59914-fs-id1168047959925"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated"/><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t">Learning Objectives</span></h3></div></div></div><p id="m59914-fs-id1168583103722"><span id="m59914-fs-id1168583103722"> </span>By the end of this section, you will be able to:</p><div class="itemizedlist" id="m59914-fs-id1168047793833"><span id="m59914-fs-id1168047793833"> </span><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p>Describe how interstellar matter is arranged around our solar system</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Explain why scientists think that the Sun is located in a hot bubble</p></li></ul></div></div><p id="m59914-fs-id1168047663632"><span id="m59914-fs-id1168047663632"> </span>We want to conclude our discussion of interstellar matter by asking how this material is organized in our immediate neighborhood. As we discussed above, orbiting X-ray observatories have shown that the Galaxy is full of bubbles of hot, X-ray-emitting gas. They also revealed a diffuse background of X-rays that appears to fill the entire sky from our perspective (<a class="xref target-figure" href="ch20.html#m59914-OSC_Astro_20_06_Xray" title="Figure&#160;20.19.&#160;Sky in X-Rays.">Figure&#160;20.19</a>). While some of this emission comes from the interaction of the solar wind with the interstellar medium, a majority of it comes from beyond the solar system. The natural explanation for why there is X-ray-emitting gas all around us is that the Sun is itself inside one of the bubbles. We therefore call our &#8220;neighborhood&#8221; the Local Hot Bubble, or <em class="glossterm" id="m59914-autoid-cnx2dbk-idm140481017219600"><span id="m59914-autoid-cnx2dbk-idm140481017219600"> </span>Local Bubble</em><a id="idm45983357377056" class="indexterm"/> for short. The Local Bubble is much less dense&#8212;an average of approximately 0.01 atoms per cm<sup>3</sup>&#8212;than the average interstellar density of about 1 atom per cm<sup>3</sup>. This local gas has a temperature of about a million degrees, just like the gas in the other superbubbles that spread throughout our Galaxy, but because there is so little hot material, this high temperature does not affect the stars or planets in the area in any way.</p><p id="m59914-fs-id1168047669035"><span id="m59914-fs-id1168047669035"> </span>What caused the Local Bubble to form? Scientists are not entirely sure, but the leading candidate is winds from stars and supernova explosions. In a nearby region in the direction of the constellations Scorpius and Centaurus, a lot of star formation took place about 15 million years ago. The most massive of these stars evolved very quickly until they produced strong winds, and some ended their lives by exploding. These processes filled the region around the Sun with hot gas, driving away cooler, denser gas. The rim of this expanding superbubble reached the Sun about 7.6 million years ago and now lies more than 200 light-years past the Sun in the general direction of the constellations of Orion, Perseus, and Auriga.</p><div id="m59914-OSC_Astro_20_06_Xray" class="figure"><div class="body"><div class="mediaobject" id="m59914-fs-id1168047330727"><span id="m59914-fs-id1168047330727"> </span><img src="m59914/OSC_Astro_20_06_Xray.jpg" alt="In this image of the X-ray sky the dark, dusty plane of the Milky Way runs from left to right across the center of the picture.

Gas found near hot stars emits light by fluorescence, that is, light is emitted when an electron is captured by an ion and cascades down to lower-energy levels. Glowing clouds (nebulae) of ionized hydrogen are called H II regions and have temperatures of about 10,000 K. Most hydrogen in interstellar space is not ionized and can best be studied by radio measurements of the 21-centimeter line. Some of the gas in interstellar space is at a temperature of a million degrees, even though it is far away in hot stars; this ultra-hot gas is probably heated when rapidly moving gas ejected in supernova explosions sweeps through space. In some places, gravity gathers interstellar gas into giant clouds, within which the gas is protected from starlight and can form molecules; more than 200 different molecules have been found in space, including the basic building blocks of proteins, which are fundamental to life as we know it here on Earth.</p></div></div><div class="section"><div class="title"><a href="#m59911"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated"/><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-n">20.3</span><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated">.&#160;</span><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t">Cosmic Dust</span></a></div><div class="body"><p id="m59911-fs-id1168047906616"><span id="m59911-fs-id1168047906616"> </span>Interstellar dust can be detected: (1) when it blocks the light of stars behind it, (2) when it scatters the light from nearby stars, and (3) because it makes distant stars look both redder and fainter. These effects are called reddening and interstellar extinction, respectively. Dust can also be detected in the infrared because it emits heat radiation. Dust is found throughout the plane of the Milky Way. The dust particles are about the same size as the wavelength of light and consist of rocky cores that are either sootlike (carbon-rich) or sandlike (silicates) with mantles made of ices such as water, ammonia, and methane.</p></div></div><div class="section"><div class="title"><a href="#m59912"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated"/><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-n">20.4</span><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated">.&#160;</span><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t">Cosmic Rays</span></a></div><div class="body"><p id="m59912-fs-id1168047686364"><span id="m59912-fs-id1168047686364"> </span>Cosmic rays are particles that travel through interstellar space at a typical speed of 90% of the speed of light.

At the same time, gas is constantly being added to the Galaxy by accretion from extragalactic space, while mass is removed from the interstellar medium by being locked in stars. Some of the mass in stars is, in turn, returned to the interstellar medium when those stars evolve and die. In particular, the heavy elements in interstellar space were all produced inside stars, while the dust grains are made in the outer regions of stars that have swelled to be giants. These elements and grains, in turn, can then be incorporated into new stars and planetary systems that form out of the interstellar medium.</p></div></div><div class="section"><div class="title"><a href="#m59914"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated"/><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-n">20.6</span><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated">.&#160;</span><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t">Interstellar Matter around the Sun</span></a></div><div class="body"><p id="m59914-fs-id1168047774754"><span id="m59914-fs-id1168047774754"> </span>The Sun is located at the edge of a low-density cloud called the Local Fluff.

How many oxygen atoms does the grain contain? What is the radius of the sphere you would have to spread them out over if you wanted them to have the same density as the interstellar medium, about 1 atom per cm<sup>3</sup>? You can look up the mass of an oxygen atom.</p>

Hydrogen is ionized only by radiation with wavelengths shorter than 91.2 nm. What is the temperature of a star that emits its maximum energy at 91.2 nm? (Use Wien&#8217;s law from <a class="link target-chapter" href="ch05.html#m59791" title="5..&#160;Thinking Ahead">Radiation and Spectra</a>.) Based on this result, what are the spectral types of those stars likely to provide enough energy to produce H II regions?</p>

Producing OVI by light requires wavelengths shorter than 10.9 nm. The hottest observed stars have surface temperatures of about 50,000 K. Could they produce OVI?</p>

Suppose a star is behind a cloud of dust that dims its brightness by a factor of 100. Suppose you do not realize the dust is there. How much in error will your distance estimate be? Can you think of any measurement you might make to detect the dust?</p>
