With thoroughness and a little luck, we can catch at least a few of them in each stage of their lives. As you&#8217;ve learned, stars have many different characteristics, with the differences sometimes resulting from their different masses, temperatures, and luminosities, and at other times derived from changes that occur as they age.

Since hydrogen is the most abundant element in stars, this process can maintain the star&#8217;s equilibrium for a long time. Thus, all stars remain on the main sequence for most of their lives.

We use the term <span class="emphasis"><em>zero-age</em></span> to mark the time when a star stops contracting, settles onto the main sequence, and begins to fuse hydrogen in its core.

It does, however, change the chemical composition in its central regions where nuclear reactions occur: hydrogen is gradually depleted, and helium accumulates. This change of composition changes the luminosity, temperature, size, and interior structure of the star. When a star&#8217;s luminosity and temperature begin to change, the point that represents the star on the H&#8211;R diagram moves away from the zero-age main sequence.</p><p id="m59925-fs-id1168047215933"><span id="m59925-fs-id1168047215933"> </span>Calculations show that the temperature and density in the inner region slowly increase as helium accumulates in the center of a star.

For the proton-proton cycle described in <a class="link target-chapter" href="ch16.html#m59880" title="16..&#160;Thinking Ahead">The Sun: A Nuclear Powerhouse</a>, the rate of fusion goes up roughly as the temperature to the fourth power.</p><p id="m59925-fs-id1168047363968"><span id="m59925-fs-id1168047363968"> </span>If the rate of fusion goes up, the rate at which energy is being generated also increases, and the luminosity of the star gradually rises.

You might think that a more massive star, having more fuel, would last longer, but it&#8217;s not that simple. The lifetime of a star in a particular stage of evolution depends on how much nuclear fuel it has and on <span class="emphasis"><em>how quickly</em></span> it uses up that fuel. (In the same way, how long people can keep spending money depends not only on how much money they have but also on how quickly they spend it. This is why many lottery winners who go on spending sprees quickly wind up poor again.) In the case of stars, more massive ones use up their fuel much more quickly than stars of low mass.</p><p id="m59925-fs-id1168048151186"><span id="m59925-fs-id1168048151186"> </span>The reason massive stars are such spendthrifts is that, as we saw above, the rate of fusion depends <span class="emphasis"><em>very</em></span> strongly on the star&#8217;s core temperature.

It is the <span class="emphasis"><em>mass</em></span> of the star&#8212;the weight of the overlying layers determines how high the pressure in the core must be: higher mass requires higher pressure to balance it. Higher pressure, in turn, is produced by higher temperature. The higher the temperature in the central regions, the faster the star races through its storehouse of central hydrogen. Although massive stars have more fuel, they burn it so prodigiously that their lifetimes are much shorter than those of their low-mass counterparts. You can also understand now why the most massive main-sequence stars are also the most luminous. Like new rock stars with their first platinum album, they spend their resources at an astounding rate.</p><p id="m59925-fs-id1168047642455"><span id="m59925-fs-id1168047642455"> </span>The main-sequence lifetimes of stars of different masses are listed in <a class="xref target-table" href="ch22.html#m59925-fs-id1168047645207" title="Table&#160;22.1.&#160;">Table&#160;22.1</a>.

Human beings developed on a planet around a G-type star. This means that the Sun&#8217;s stable main-sequence lifetime is so long that it afforded life on Earth plenty of time to evolve. When searching for intelligent life like our own on planets around other stars, it would be a pretty big waste of time to search around O- or B-type stars. These stars remain stable for such a short time that the development of creatures complicated enough to take astronomy courses is very unlikely.</p></div><div class="section" id="m59925-fs-id1168047784110"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 id="m59925-fs-id1168047784110"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated"/><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t">From Main-Sequence Star to Red Giant</span></h3></div></div></div><p id="m59925-fs-id1168047287026"><span id="m59925-fs-id1168047287026"> </span>Eventually, all the hydrogen in a star&#8217;s core, where it is hot enough for fusion reactions, is used up. The core then contains only helium, &#8220;contaminated&#8221; by whatever small percentage of heavier elements the star had to begin with. The helium in the core can be thought of as the accumulated &#8220;ash&#8221; from the nuclear &#8220;burning&#8221; of hydrogen during the main-sequence stage.</p><p id="m59925-fs-id1168047367284"><span id="m59925-fs-id1168047367284"> </span>Energy can no longer be generated by hydrogen fusion in the stellar core because the hydrogen is all gone and, as we will see, the fusion of helium requires much higher temperatures. Since the central temperature is not yet high enough to fuse helium, there is no nuclear energy source to supply heat to the central region of the star. The long period of stability now ends, gravity again takes over, and the core begins to contract. Once more, the star&#8217;s energy is partially supplied by gravitational energy, in the way described by Kelvin and Helmholtz (see <a class="link target-chapter" href="ch16.html#m59895" title="16.1.&#160;Sources of Sunshine: Thermal and Gravitational Energy">Sources of Sunshine: Thermal and Gravitational Energy</a>).

In the process, the heat raises the temperature of a layer of hydrogen that spent the whole long main-sequence time just outside the core. Like an understudy waiting in the wings of a hit Broadway show for a chance at fame and glory, this hydrogen was almost (but not quite) hot enough to undergo fusion and take part in the main action that sustains the star. Now, the additional heat produced by the shrinking core puts this hydrogen &#8220;over the limit,&#8221; and a shell of hydrogen nuclei just outside the core becomes hot enough for hydrogen fusion to begin.</p><p id="m59925-fs-id1168047201373"><span id="m59925-fs-id1168047201373"> </span>New energy produced by fusion of this hydrogen now pours outward from this shell and begins to heat up layers of the star farther out, causing them to expand. Meanwhile, the helium core continues to contract, producing more heat right around it. This leads to more fusion in the shell of fresh hydrogen outside the core (<a class="xref target-figure" href="ch22.html#m59925-OSC_Astro_22_01_Shell" title="Figure&#160;22.2.&#160;Star Layers during and after the Main Sequence.">Figure&#160;22.2</a>).

After &#8220;2.46 &#215; 108&#8221; years its temperature has dropped to near 6000 K. Then, its luminosity increases by about a factor of ten where its curve ends at &#8220;2.51 &#215; 107&#8221; years and 5000 K. Next, a star of &#8220;1.5 solar masses&#8221; leaves the main sequence near L = 30 and 9000 K. After &#8220;1.55 &#215; 109&#8221; years its temperature has fallen to near 7500 K. After &#8220;2.09 &#215; 109&#8221; years, its temperature has dropped to near 5000 K. Then, its luminosity increases by about a factor of one hundred where its curve ends at &#8220;2.39 &#215; 109&#8221; years and 4000 K. Next, a star of &#8220;1 solar mass&#8221; leaves the main sequence at L = 1 and 5700 K. After &#8220;7 &#215; 109&#8221; years its temperature is nearly the same, but its luminosity has increased slightly. After &#8220;10.4 &#215; 109&#8221; years, its temperature has dropped to near 5000 K, and its luminosity has increased about 20 times. Then, its luminosity steadily increases to where its curve ends at &#8220;11.4 &#215; 109&#8221; years, L ~ 103 and T ~ 4000 K. Finally, a &#8220;0.5 solar mass&#8221; star is partially plotted. Its curve begins at L ~ 10-1 near T ~ 5000. Its curve is a short arrow pointing upward as its evolutionary timescale is too great for this diagram."/></div></div><div class="title"><span class="cnx-gentext-figure cnx-gentext-autogenerated">Figure&#160;</span><span class="cnx-gentext-figure cnx-gentext-n">22.5</span><span class="cnx-gentext-figure cnx-gentext-autogenerated">.&#160;</span><span class="cnx-gentext-figure cnx-gentext-t">Evolutionary Tracks of Stars of Different Masses.</span></div><div class="caption">The solid black lines show the predicted evolution from the main sequence through the red giant or supergiant stage on the H&#8211;R diagram.

The line continues upward to L ~ 1000 and T ~ 3000 to point &#8220;(b),&#8221; labeled &#8220;Core helium flash.&#8221; From point b, the line (now dashed) moves downward to L ~ 100 and T ~ 5000 and labeled &#8220;(c),&#8221; and is described in the caption. From c, the line moves upward again. This portion of the line is labeled &#8220;(d),&#8221; and is described in the caption.

Thus, the new period of stability cannot last very long: it is far shorter than the main-sequence stage. Soon, all the helium hot enough for fusion will be used up, just like the hot hydrogen that was used up earlier in the star&#8217;s evolution. Once again, the inner core will not be able to generate energy via fusion. Once more, gravity will take over, and the core will start to shrink again. We can think of stellar evolution as a story of a constant struggle against gravitational collapse. A star can avoid collapsing as long as it can tap energy sources, but once any particular fuel is used up, it starts to collapse again.</p><p id="m59928-fs-id1168048593159"><span id="m59928-fs-id1168048593159"> </span>The star&#8217;s situation is analogous to the end of the main-sequence stage (when the central hydrogen got used up), but the star now has a somewhat more complicated structure. Again, the star&#8217;s core begins to collapse under its own weight. Heat released by the shrinking of the carbon and oxygen core flows into a shell of helium just above the core. This helium, which had not been hot enough for fusion into carbon earlier, is heated just enough for fusion to begin and to generate a new flow of energy.</p><p id="m59928-fs-id1168048648837"><span id="m59928-fs-id1168048648837"> </span>Farther out in the star, there is also a shell where fresh hydrogen has been heated enough to fuse helium.

(a) Perhaps the best known planetary nebula is the Ring Nebula (M57), located about 2000 light-years away in the constellation of Lyra. The ring is about 1 light-year in diameter, and the central star has a temperature of about 120,000 &#176;C. Careful study of this image has shown scientists that, instead of looking at a spherical shell around this dying star, we may be looking down the barrel of a tube or cone. The blue region shows emission from very hot helium, which is located very close to the star; the red region isolates emission from ionized nitrogen, which is radiated by the coolest gas farthest from the star; and the green region represents oxygen emission, which is produced at intermediate temperatures and is at an intermediate distance from the star. (b) This planetary nebula, M2-9, is an example of a butterfly nebula. The central star (which is part of a binary system) has ejected mass preferentially in two opposite directions. In other images, a disk, perpendicular to the two long streams of gas, can be seen around the two stars in the middle. The stellar outburst that resulted in the expulsion of matter occurred about 1200 years ago. Neutral oxygen is shown in red, once-ionized nitrogen in green, and twice-ionized oxygen in blue. The planetary nebula is about 2100 light-years away in the constellation of Ophiuchus. (c) In this image of the planetary nebula NGC 6751, the blue regions mark the hottest gas, which forms a ring around the central star. The orange and red regions show the locations of cooler gas. The origin of these cool streamers is not known, but their shapes indicate that they are affected by radiation and stellar winds from the hot star at the center. The temperature of the star is about 140,000 &#176;C. The diameter of the nebula is about 600 times larger than the diameter of our solar system. The nebula is about 6500 light-years away in the constellation of Aquila. (d) This image of the planetary nebula NGC 7027 shows several stages of mass loss. The faint blue concentric shells surrounding the central region identify the mass that was shed slowly from the surface of the star when it became a red giant. Somewhat later, the remaining outer layers were ejected but not in a spherically symmetric way. The dense clouds formed by this late ejection produce the bright inner regions. The hot central star can be seen faintly near the center of the nebulosity. NGC 7027 is about 3000 light-years away in the direction of the constellation of Cygnus.

The basic shape is a hot central star surrounded by a thick torus (or doughnut-shaped disk) of gas. The star&#8217;s wind cannot flow out into space very easily in the direction of the torus, but can escape more freely in the two directions perpendicular to it. If we view the nebula along the direction of the flow (Helix Nebula), it will appear nearly circular (like looking directly down into an empty ice-cream cone). If we look along the equator of the torus, we see both outflows and a very elongated shape (Hubble 5). Current research on planetary nebulae focuses on the reasons for having a torus around the star in the first place. Many astronomers suggest that the basic cause may be that many of the central stars are actually close binary stars, rather than single stars.

If we assume that the gas shell has expanded at a constant speed, we can calculate that the shells of all the planetary nebulae visible to us were ejected within the past 50,000 years at most. After this amount of time, the shells have expanded so much that they are too thin and tenuous to be seen. That&#8217;s a pretty short time that each planetary nebula can be observed (when compared to the whole lifetime of the star). Given the number of such nebulae we nevertheless see, we must conclude that a large fraction of all stars evolve through the planetary nebula phase. Since we saw that low-mass stars are much more common than high-mass stars, this confirms our view of planetary nebulae as sort of &#8220;last gasp&#8221; of low-mass star evolution.</p></div><div class="section" id="m59928-fs-id1168048304828"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 id="m59928-fs-id1168048304828"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated"/><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t">Cosmic Recycling</span></h3></div></div></div><p id="m59928-fs-id1168046063180"><span id="m59928-fs-id1168046063180"> </span>The loss of mass by dying stars is a key step in the gigantic cosmic recycling scheme we discussed in <a class="link target-chapter" href="ch20.html#m59908" title="20..&#160;Thinking Ahead">Between the Stars: Gas and Dust in Space</a>.

The star, after all, has fused hydrogen and helium to form new elements over the course of its life. And during the red-giant stage, material from the star&#8217;s central regions is dredged up and mixed with its outer layers, which can cause further nuclear reactions and the creation of still more new elements. As a result, the winds that blow outward from such stars include atoms that were &#8220;newly minted&#8221; inside the stars&#8217; cores. (As we will see, this mechanism is even more effective for high-mass stars, but it does work for stars with masses like that of the Sun.) In this way, the raw material of the Galaxy is not only resupplied but also receives infusions of new elements. You might say this cosmic recycling plan allows the universe to get more &#8220;interesting&#8221; all the time.</p><div id="m59928-fs-id1168046134713" class="note astronomy making-connections"><div class="title"><span class="cnx-gentext-tip-t">The Red Giant Sun and the Fate of Earth</span></div><div class="body"><p id="m59928-fs-id1168048545531"><span id="m59928-fs-id1168048545531"> </span>How will the evolution of the Sun affect conditions on Earth in the future? Although the Sun has appeared reasonably steady in size and luminosity over recorded human history, that brief span means nothing compared with the timescales we have been discussing. Let&#8217;s examine the long-term prospects for our planet.</p><p id="m59928-fs-id1168048760195"><span id="m59928-fs-id1168048760195"> </span>The Sun took its place on the zero-age main sequence approximately 4.5 billion years ago. At that time, it emitted only about 70% of the energy that it radiates today. One might expect that Earth would have been a lot colder than it is now, with the oceans frozen solid. But if this were the case, it would be hard to explain why simple life forms existed when Earth was less than a billion years old. Scientists now think that the explanation may be that much more carbon dioxide was present in Earth&#8217;s atmosphere when it was young, and that a much stronger greenhouse effect kept Earth warm. (In the greenhouse effect, gases like carbon dioxide or water vapor allow the Sun&#8217;s light to come in but do not allow the infrared radiation from the ground to escape back into space, so the temperature near Earth&#8217;s surface increases.)</p><p id="m59928-fs-id1168048775665"><span id="m59928-fs-id1168048775665"> </span>Carbon dioxide in Earth&#8217;s atmosphere has steadily declined as the Sun has increased in luminosity. As the brighter Sun increases the temperature of Earth, rocks weather faster and react with carbon dioxide, removing it from the atmosphere. The warmer Sun and the weaker greenhouse effect have kept Earth at a nearly constant temperature for most of its life. This remarkable coincidence, which has resulted in fairly stable climatic conditions, has been the key in the development of complex life-forms on our planet.</p><p id="m59928-fs-id1168048558340"><span id="m59928-fs-id1168048558340"> </span>As a result of changes caused by the buildup of helium in its core, the Sun will continue to increase in luminosity as it grows older, and more and more radiation will reach Earth. For a while, the amount of carbon dioxide will continue to decrease. (Note that this effect counteracts increases in carbon dioxide from human activities, but on a much-too-slow timescale to undo the changes in climate that are likely to occur in the next 100 years.)</p><p id="m59928-fs-id1168048483200"><span id="m59928-fs-id1168048483200"> </span>Eventually, the heating of Earth will melt the polar caps and increase the evaporation of the oceans. Water vapor is also an efficient greenhouse gas and will more than compensate for the decrease in carbon dioxide. Sooner or later (atmospheric models are not yet good enough to say exactly when, but estimates range from 500 million to 2 billion years), the increased water vapor will cause a runaway greenhouse effect.</p><p id="m59928-fs-id1168048365379"><span id="m59928-fs-id1168048365379"> </span>About 1 billion years from now, Earth will lose its water vapor. In the upper atmosphere, sunlight will break down water vapor into hydrogen, and the fast-moving hydrogen atoms will escape into outer space. Like Humpty Dumpty, the water molecules cannot be put back together again. Earth will start to resemble the Venus of today, and temperatures will become much too high for life as we know it.</p><p id="m59928-fs-id1168048780128"><span id="m59928-fs-id1168048780128"> </span>All of this will happen before the Sun even becomes a red giant. Then the bad news really starts. The Sun, as it expands, will swallow Mercury and Venus, and friction with our star&#8217;s outer atmosphere will make these planets spiral inward until they are completely vaporized. It is not completely clear whether Earth will escape a similar fate. As described in this chapter, the Sun will lose some of its mass as it becomes a red giant. The gravitational pull of the Sun decreases when it loses mass. The result would be that the diameter of Earth&#8217;s orbit would increase (remember Kepler&#8217;s third law). However, recent calculations also show that forces due to the tides raised on the Sun by Earth will act in the opposite direction, causing Earth&#8217;s orbit to shrink. Thus, many astrophysicists conclude that Earth will be vaporized along with Mercury and Venus. Whether or not this dire prediction is true, there is little doubt that all life on Earth will surely be incinerated. But don&#8217;t lose any sleep over this&#8212;we are talking about events that will occur billions of years from now.</p><p id="m59928-fs-id1168048488207"><span id="m59928-fs-id1168048488207"> </span>What then are the prospects for preserving Earth life as we know it? The first strategy you might think of would be to move humanity to a more distant and cooler planet. However, calculations indicate that there are long periods of time (several hundred million years) when no planet is habitable. For example, Earth becomes far too warm for life long before Mars warms up enough.</p><p id="m59928-fs-id1168048484240"><span id="m59928-fs-id1168048484240"> </span>A better alternative may be to move the entire Earth progressively farther from the Sun. The idea is to use gravity in the same way NASA has used it to send spacecraft to distant planets. When a spacecraft flies near a planet, the planet&#8217;s motion can be used to speed up the spacecraft, slow it down, or redirect it. Calculations show that if we were to redirect an asteroid so that it follows just the right orbit between Earth and Jupiter, it could transfer orbital energy from Jupiter to Earth and move Earth slowly outward, pulling us away from the expanding Sun on each flyby. Since we have hundreds of millions of years to change Earth&#8217;s orbit, the effect of each flyby need not be large. (Of course, the people directing the asteroid had better get the orbit exactly right and not cause the asteroid to hit Earth.)</p><p id="m59928-fs-id1168048368051"><span id="m59928-fs-id1168048368051"> </span>It may seem crazy to think about projects to move an entire planet to a different orbit. But remember that we are talking about the distant future. If, by some miracle, human beings are able to get along for all that time and don&#8217;t blow ourselves to bits, our technology is likely to be far more sophisticated than it is today. It may also be that if humans survive for hundreds of millions of years, we may spread to planets or habitats around other stars. Indeed, Earth, by then, might be a museum world to which youngsters from other planets return to learn about the origin of our species. It is also possible that evolution will by then have changed us in ways that allow us to survive in very different environments. Wouldn&#8217;t it be exciting to see how the story of the story of the human race turns out after all those billions of years?</p></div></div></div></div><div xml:lang="en" class="section module" id="m59930"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 id="m59930"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated"/><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-n">22.5</span><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated">.&#160;</span><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t">The Evolution of More Massive Stars<sup><a href="co03.html#book-attribution-m59930">*</a></sup></span></h2></div><div class="abstract"><div class="title"><span><span class="cnx-gentext-abstract cnx-gentext-autogenerated"/><span class="cnx-gentext-abstract cnx-gentext-t"/></span></div><p/></div></div></div><div class="toc"><ul><li class="toc-section learning-objectives"><a href="#m59930-fs-id1168047971021" class="target-section"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t">Learning Objectives</span></a></li><li class="toc-section"><a href="#m59930-fs-id1168047402451" class="target-section"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t">Making New Elements in Massive Stars</span></a></li><li class="toc-section"><a href="#m59930-fs-id1168047184058" class="target-section"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t">Elements in Globular Clusters and Open Clusters Are Not the Same</span></a></li><li class="toc-section"><a href="#m59930-fs-id1168047456789" class="target-section"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t">Approaching Death</span></a></li></ul></div><div class="section learning-objectives" id="m59930-fs-id1168047971021"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 id="m59930-fs-id1168047971021"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated"/><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t">Learning Objectives</span></h3></div></div></div><p id="m59930-fs-id1168584294881"><span id="m59930-fs-id1168584294881"> </span>By the end of this section, you will be able to:</p><div class="itemizedlist" id="m59930-fs-id1168047596489"><span id="m59930-fs-id1168047596489"> </span><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p>Explain how and why massive stars evolve much more rapidly than lower-mass stars like our Sun</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Discuss the origin of the elements heavier than carbon within stars</p></li></ul></div></div><p id="m59930-fs-id1168047615718"><span id="m59930-fs-id1168047615718"> </span>If what we have described so far were the whole story of the evolution of stars and elements, we would have a big problem on our hands.

All the predictions of the models imply that no heavier elements were produced at the beginning of the universe. Yet when we look around us on Earth, we see lots of other elements besides hydrogen and helium. These elements must have been made (fused) somewhere in the universe, <span class="emphasis"><em>and the only place hot enough to make them is inside stars</em></span>.

The very first generation of stars initially contained only hydrogen and helium. We have seen that these stars, in order to generate energy, created heavier elements in their interiors. In the last stages of their lives, they ejected matter, now enriched in heavy elements, into the reservoirs of raw material between the stars. Such matter was then incorporated into a new generation of stars.</p><p id="m59930-fs-id1168047420254"><span id="m59930-fs-id1168047420254"> </span>This means that the relative abundance of the heavy elements must be less and less as we look further into the past. We saw that the globular clusters are much older than the open clusters. Since globular-cluster stars formed much earlier (that is, they are an earlier generation of stars) than those in open clusters, they have only a relatively small abundance of elements heavier than hydrogen and helium.</p><p id="m59930-fs-id1168047644546"><span id="m59930-fs-id1168047644546"> </span>As time passes, the proportion of heavier elements in the &#8220;raw material&#8221; that makes new stars and planets increases. This means that the first generation of stars that formed in our Galaxy would not have been accompanied by a planet like Earth, full of silicon, iron, and many other heavy elements. Earth (and the astronomy students who live on it) was possible only after generations of stars had a chance to make and recycle their heavier elements.</p><p id="m59930-fs-id1168047843396"><span id="m59930-fs-id1168047843396"> </span>Now the search is on for true <span class="emphasis"><em>first</em></span>-generation stars, made only of hydrogen and helium. Theories predict that such stars should be very massive, live fast, and die quickly. They should have lived and died long ago. The place to look for them is in very distant galaxies that formed when the universe was only a few hundred million years old, but whose light is only arriving at Earth now.</p></div><div class="section" id="m59930-fs-id1168047456789"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 id="m59930-fs-id1168047456789"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated"/><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t">Approaching Death</span></h3></div></div></div><p id="m59930-fs-id1168047792841"><span id="m59930-fs-id1168047792841"> </span>Compared with the main-sequence lifetimes of stars, the events that characterize the last stages of <em class="glossterm no-emphasis" id="m59930-autoid-cnx2dbk-idm140481007747120"><span id="m59930-autoid-cnx2dbk-idm140481007747120"> </span>stellar evolution</em><a id="idm45983355267776" class="indexterm"/> pass very quickly (especially for massive stars).

But the energy yield of these reactions is much less than that of the fusion of hydrogen to helium. And to trigger these reactions, the central temperature must be higher than that required for the fusion of hydrogen to helium, leading to even more rapid consumption of fuel. Clearly this is a losing game, and very quickly the star reaches its end.

The amount of time a star spends in the main-sequence stage depends on its mass. More massive stars complete each stage of evolution more quickly than lower-mass stars. The fusion of hydrogen to form helium changes the interior composition of a star, which in turn results in changes in its temperature, luminosity, and radius. Eventually, as stars age, they evolve away from the main sequence to become red giants or supergiants. The core of a red giant is contracting, but the outer layers are expanding as a result of hydrogen fusion in a shell outside the core. The star gets larger, redder, and more luminous as it expands and cools.</p></div></div><div class="section"><div class="title"><a href="#m59926"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated"/><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-n">22.2</span><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated">.&#160;</span><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t">Star Clusters</span></a></div><div class="body"><p id="m59926-fs-id1168047663499"><span id="m59926-fs-id1168047663499"> </span>Star clusters provide one of the best tests of our calculations of what happens as stars age. The stars in a given cluster were formed at about the same time and have the same composition, so they differ mainly in mass, and thus, in their life stage. There are three types of star clusters: globular, open, and associations. Globular clusters have diameters of 50&#8211;450 light-years, contain hundreds of thousands of stars, and are distributed in a halo around the Galaxy. Open clusters typically contain hundreds of stars, are located in the plane of the Galaxy, and have diameters less than 30 light-years. Associations are found in regions of gas and dust and contain extremely young stars.</p></div></div><div class="section"><div class="title"><a href="#m59927"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated"/><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-n">22.3</span><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated">.&#160;</span><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t">Checking Out the Theory</span></a></div><div class="body"><p id="m59927-fs-id1168047611639"><span id="m59927-fs-id1168047611639"> </span>The H&#8211;R diagram of stars in a cluster changes systematically as the cluster grows older. The most massive stars evolve most rapidly. In the youngest clusters and associations, highly luminous blue stars are on the main sequence; the stars with the lowest masses lie to the right of the main sequence and are still contracting toward it. With passing time, stars of progressively lower masses evolve away from (or turn off) the main sequence. In globular clusters, which are all at least 11 billion years old, there are no luminous blue stars at all. Astronomers can use the turnoff point from the main sequence to determine the age of a cluster.</p></div></div><div class="section"><div class="title"><a href="#m59928"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated"/><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-n">22.4</span><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated">.&#160;</span><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t">Further Evolution of Stars</span></a></div><div class="body"><p id="m59928-fs-id1168048373805"><span id="m59928-fs-id1168048373805"> </span>After stars become red giants, their cores eventually become hot enough to produce energy by fusing helium to form carbon (and sometimes a bit of oxygen.) The fusion of three helium nuclei produces carbon through the triple-alpha process. The rapid onset of helium fusion in the core of a low-mass star is called the helium flash. After this, the star becomes stable and reduces its luminosity and size briefly. In stars with masses about twice the mass of the Sun or less, fusion stops after the helium in the core has been exhausted. Fusion of hydrogen and helium in shells around the contracting core makes the star a bright red giant again, but only temporarily. When the star is a red giant, it can shed its outer layers and thereby expose hot inner layers. Planetary nebulae (which have nothing to do with planets) are shells of gas ejected by such stars, set glowing by the ultraviolet radiation of the dying central star.</p></div></div><div class="section"><div class="title"><a href="#m59930"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated"/><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-n">22.5</span><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated">.&#160;</span><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t">The Evolution of More Massive Stars</span></a></div><div class="body"><p id="m59930-fs-id1168047648484"><span id="m59930-fs-id1168047648484"> </span>In stars with masses higher than about 8 solar masses, nuclear reactions involving carbon, oxygen, and still heavier elements can build up nuclei as heavy as iron. The creation of new chemical elements is called nucleosynthesis. The late stages of evolution occur very quickly. Ultimately, all stars must use up all of their available energy supplies. In the process of dying, most stars eject some matter, enriched in heavy elements, into interstellar space where it can be used to form new stars. Each succeeding generation of stars therefore contains a larger proportion of elements heavier than hydrogen and helium. This progressive enrichment explains why the stars in open clusters (which formed more recently) contain more heavy elements than do those in ancient globular clusters, and it tells us where most of the atoms on Earth and in our bodies come from.</p></div></div></div><!--CNX: Start Area: "For Further Exploration"--><div class="cnx-eoc further-exploration"><div class="title"><span>For Further Exploration</span></div><div class="section empty"><div class="title"><a href="#m59924"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated"/><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-n">22.</span><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated">.&#160;</span><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t">Thinking Ahead</span></a></div><div class="body"/></div><div class="section empty"><div class="title"><a href="#m59925"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated"/><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-n">22.1</span><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated">.&#160;</span><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t">Evolution from the Main Sequence to Red Giants</span></a></div><div class="body"/></div><div class="section empty"><div class="title"><a href="#m59926"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated"/><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-n">22.2</span><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated">.&#160;</span><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t">Star Clusters</span></a></div><div class="body"/></div><div class="section empty"><div class="title"><a href="#m59927"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated"/><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-n">22.3</span><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated">.&#160;</span><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t">Checking Out the Theory</span></a></div><div class="body"/></div><div class="section empty"><div class="title"><a href="#m59928"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated"/><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-n">22.4</span><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated">.&#160;</span><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t">Further Evolution of Stars</span></a></div><div class="body"/></div><div class="section"><div class="title"><a href="#m59930"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated"/><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-n">22.5</span><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated">.&#160;</span><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t">The Evolution of More Massive Stars</span></a></div><div class="body"><div class="section" id="m59930-fs-id1168047402681"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 id="m59930-fs-id1168047402681"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated"/><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t">Articles</span></h4></div></div></div><p id="m59930-fs-id1168047878162"><span id="m59930-fs-id1168047878162"> </span>Balick, B. &amp; Frank, A. &#8220;The Extraordinary Deaths of Ordinary Stars.&#8221; <span class="emphasis"><em>Scientific American</em></span> (July 2004): 50.

Look in earlier chapters to find out what percentage of the hydrogen mass involved in fusion is lost because it is converted to energy.

Use the information in the figures to determine the luminosity of the most massive star still on the main sequence.

Then calculate the age of the cluster. This method is similar to the procedure used by astronomers to obtain the ages of clusters, except that they use actual data and model calculations rather than simply making estimates from a drawing. How do your ages compare with the ages in the text?</p>
