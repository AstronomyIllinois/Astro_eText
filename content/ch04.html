We thus divide the year into <span class="emphasis"><em>seasons</em></span>, each with its different amount of sunlight. The difference between seasons gets more pronounced the farther north or south from the equator we travel, and the seasons in the Southern Hemisphere are the opposite of what we find on the northern half of Earth. With these observed facts in mind, let us ask what causes the seasons.</p><p id="m59785-fs-id1168048471314"><span id="m59785-fs-id1168048471314"> </span>Many people have believed that the seasons were the result of the changing distance between Earth and the Sun. This sounds reasonable at first: it should be colder when Earth is farther from the Sun. But the facts don&#8217;t bear out this hypothesis. Although Earth&#8217;s orbit around the Sun is an ellipse, its distance from the Sun varies by only about 3%. That&#8217;s not enough to cause significant variations in the Sun&#8217;s heating. To make matters worse for people in North America who hold this hypothesis, Earth is actually closest to the Sun in January, when the Northern Hemisphere is in the middle of winter. And if distance were the governing factor, why would the two hemispheres have opposite seasons? As we shall show, the seasons are actually caused by the 23.5&#176; tilt of Earth&#8217;s axis.</p><div class="section" id="m59785-fs-id1168046132466"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 id="m59785-fs-id1168046132466"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated"/><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t">The Seasons and Sunshine</span></h3></div></div></div><p id="m59785-fs-id1168048782920"><span id="m59785-fs-id1168048782920"> </span><a class="xref target-figure" href="ch04.html#m59785-OSC_Astro_04_02_Seasons" title="Figure&#160;4.5.&#160;Seasons.">Figure&#160;4.5</a> shows Earth&#8217;s annual path around the <em class="glossterm no-emphasis" id="m59785-autoid-cnx2dbk-idm140481009879376"><span id="m59785-autoid-cnx2dbk-idm140481009879376"> </span>Sun</em><a id="idm45983378050832" class="indexterm"/>, with Earth&#8217;s axis tilted by 23.5&#176;.

You can get a similar effect by shining a flashlight onto a wall. If you shine the flashlight straight on, you get an intense spot of light on the wall. But if you hold the flashlight at an angle (if the wall &#8220;leans out&#8221; of the beam), then the spot of light is more spread out. Like the straight-on light, the sunlight in June is more direct and intense in the Northern Hemisphere, and hence more effective at heating.</p><div id="m59785-OSC_Astro_04_02_Sunray" class="figure"><div class="body"><div class="mediaobject" id="m59785-fs-id1168048307497"><span id="m59785-fs-id1168048307497"> </span><img src="m59785/OSC_Astro_04_02_Sunray.jpg" alt="The Sun&#8217;s Rays in Summer and Winter.

Because Earth&#8217;s axis is tilted, the ecliptic is tilted by about 23.5&#176; relative to the celestial equator (review <a class="xref target-figure" href="ch02.html#m59770-OSC_Astro_02_01_Celestial" title="Figure&#160;2.7.&#160;The Celestial Tilt.">Figure&#160;2.7</a>).

On or about June 21 (the date we who live in the Northern Hemisphere call the <span class="emphasis"><em>summer solstice</em></span> or sometimes the first day of summer), the Sun shines down most directly upon the Northern Hemisphere of Earth. It appears about 23&#176; north of the equator, and thus, on that date, it passes through the zenith of places on Earth that are at 23&#176; N latitude. The situation is shown in detail in <a class="xref target-figure" href="ch04.html#m59785-OSC_Astro_04_02_Earth" title="Figure&#160;4.8.&#160;Earth on June 21.">Figure&#160;4.8</a>.

If Earth were tilted less, the seasons would be less extreme. The variation in day length and direct sunlight would be very small over the course of a year, and the Sun&#8217;s daily path in the sky would not vary much. If Earth were tilted by 5&#176;, the Sun&#8217;s position on the day of the summer solstice would be 5&#176; N of the celestial equator, so the Tropic of Cancer would be at the corresponding latitude on Earth of 5&#176; N of the Equator. The Arctic Circle would be located at 90&#176; &#8211; 5&#176; = 85&#176; N of the equator.</p><p id="m59785-fs-id1168048747315"><span id="m59785-fs-id1168048747315"> </span></p><div class="title"><b>Check Your Learning</b></div><p>

The difference between these two latitudes is 74&#176; &#8211; 16&#176; = 58&#176;.

In reality, however, the atmosphere has the curious effect of allowing us to see a little way &#8220;over the horizon.&#8221; This effect is a result of <span class="emphasis"><em>refraction</em></span>, the bending of light passing through air or water, something we will discuss in <a class="link target-chapter" href="ch06.html#m59802" title="6..&#160;Thinking Ahead">Astronomical Instruments</a>.

The hottest months in the Northern Hemisphere are July and August. This is because our weather involves the air and water covering Earth&#8217;s surface, and these large reservoirs do not heat up instantaneously. You have probably observed this effect for yourself; for example, a pond does not get warm the moment the Sun rises but is warmest late in the afternoon, after it has had time to absorb the Sun&#8217;s heat. In the same way, Earth gets warmer after it has had a chance to absorb the extra sunlight that is the Sun&#8217;s summer gift to us. And the coldest times of winter are a month or more after the winter solstice.</p></div></div><div xml:lang="en" class="section module" id="m59786"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 id="m59786"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated"/><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-n">4.3</span><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated">.&#160;</span><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t">Keeping Time<sup><a href="co03.html#book-attribution-m59786">*</a></sup></span></h2></div><div class="abstract"><div class="title"><span><span class="cnx-gentext-abstract cnx-gentext-autogenerated"/><span class="cnx-gentext-abstract cnx-gentext-t"/></span></div><p/></div></div></div><div class="toc"><ul><li class="toc-section learning-objectives"><a href="#m59786-fs-id1168048320362" class="target-section"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t">Learning Objectives</span></a></li><li class="toc-section"><a href="#m59786-fs-id1168046232228" class="target-section"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t">The Length of the Day</span></a></li><li class="toc-section"><a href="#m59786-fs-id1168046065847" class="target-section"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t">Apparent Solar Time</span></a></li><li class="toc-section"><a href="#m59786-fs-id1168048651572" class="target-section"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t">Mean Solar Time and Standard Time</span></a></li><li class="toc-section"><a href="#m59786-fs-id1168048760014" class="target-section"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t">The International Date Line</span></a></li></ul></div><div class="section learning-objectives" id="m59786-fs-id1168048320362"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 id="m59786-fs-id1168048320362"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated"/><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t">Learning Objectives</span></h3></div></div></div><p id="m59786-fs-id1168980710804"><span id="m59786-fs-id1168980710804"> </span>By the end of this section, you will be able to:</p><div class="itemizedlist" id="m59786-fs-id1168048521873"><span id="m59786-fs-id1168048521873"> </span><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p>Explain the difference between the solar day and the sidereal day</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Explain mean solar time and the reason for <em class="glossterm no-emphasis" id="m59786-autoid-cnx2dbk-idm140481011358192"><span id="m59786-autoid-cnx2dbk-idm140481011358192"> </span>time zones</em><a id="idm45983377920608" class="indexterm"/></p></li></ul></div></div><p id="m59786-fs-id1168048516675"><span id="m59786-fs-id1168048516675"> </span>The measurement of time is based on the rotation of Earth.

The exact length of an apparent solar day varies slightly during the year. The eastward progress of the Sun in its annual journey around the sky is not uniform because the speed of Earth varies slightly in its elliptical orbit. Another complication is that Earth&#8217;s axis of rotation is not perpendicular to the plane of its revolution. Thus, apparent solar time does not advance at a uniform rate. After the invention of mechanical clocks that run at a uniform rate, it became necessary to abandon the apparent solar day as the fundamental unit of time.</p></div><div class="section" id="m59786-fs-id1168048651572"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 id="m59786-fs-id1168048651572"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated"/><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t">Mean Solar Time and Standard Time</span></h3></div></div></div><p id="m59786-fs-id1168048243711"><span id="m59786-fs-id1168048243711"> </span>Instead, we can consider the <em class="glossterm" id="m59786-autoid-cnx2dbk-idm140481009672640"><span id="m59786-autoid-cnx2dbk-idm140481009672640"> </span>mean solar time</em><a id="idm45983377822240" class="indexterm"/>, which is based on the average value of the solar day over the course of the year. A mean solar day contains exactly 24 hours and is what we use in our everyday timekeeping. Although mean solar time has the advantage of progressing at a uniform rate, it is still inconvenient for practical use because it is determined by the position of the Sun. For example, noon occurs when the Sun is highest in the sky on the meridian (but not necessarily at the zenith).

For instance, a commuter traveling from Oyster Bay on Long Island to New York City would have to adjust the time on the trip through the East River tunnel because Oyster Bay time is actually about 1.6 minutes more advanced than that of Manhattan. (Imagine an airplane trip in which an obnoxious flight attendant gets on the intercom every minute, saying, &#8220;Please reset your watch for local mean time.&#8221;)</p><p id="m59786-fs-id1168048336569"><span id="m59786-fs-id1168048336569"> </span>Until near the end of the nineteenth century, every city and town in the United States kept its own local mean time. With the development of railroads and the telegraph, however, the need for some kind of standardization became evident. In 1883, the United States was divided into four standard time zones (now six, including Hawaii and Alaska), each with one system of time within that zone.</p><p id="m59786-fs-id1168048316051"><span id="m59786-fs-id1168048316051"> </span>By 1900, most of the world was using the system of 24 standardized global time zones.

It does not, of course, &#8220;save&#8221; any daylight at all&#8212;because the amount of sunlight is not determined by what we do with our clocks&#8212;and its observance is a point of legislative debate in some states.</p></div><div class="section" id="m59786-fs-id1168048760014"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 id="m59786-fs-id1168048760014"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated"/><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t">The International Date Line</span></h3></div></div></div><p id="m59786-fs-id1168048742143"><span id="m59786-fs-id1168048742143"> </span>The fact that time is always advancing as you move toward the east presents a problem.

The second feature of the new Gregorian calendar was a change in the rule for leap year, making the average length of the year more closely approximate the tropical year. Gregory decreed that three of every four century years&#8212;all leap years under the Julian calendar&#8212;would be common years henceforth. The rule was that only century years divisible by 400 would be leap years. Thus, 1700, 1800, and 1900&#8212;all divisible by 4 but not by 400&#8212;were not leap years in the Gregorian calendar. On the other hand, the years 1600 and 2000, both divisible by 400, were leap years.

It was 1752 when England and the American colonies finally made the change. By parliamentary decree, September 2, 1752, was followed by September 14. Although special laws were passed to prevent such abuses as landlords collecting a full month&#8217;s rent for September, there were still riots, and people demanded their 12 days back. Russia did not abandon the Julian calendar until the time of the Bolshevik revolution. The Russians then had to omit 13 days to come into step with the rest of the world. The anniversary of the October Revolution (old calendar) of 1917, bringing the communists to power, thus ended up being celebrated in November (new calendar), a difference that is perhaps not so important since the fall of communism.</p></div></div><div xml:lang="en" class="section module" id="m59788"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 id="m59788"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated"/><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-n">4.5</span><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated">.&#160;</span><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t">Phases and Motions of the Moon<sup><a href="co03.html#book-attribution-m59788">*</a></sup></span></h2></div><div class="abstract"><div class="title"><span><span class="cnx-gentext-abstract cnx-gentext-autogenerated"/><span class="cnx-gentext-abstract cnx-gentext-t"/></span></div><p/></div></div></div><div class="toc"><ul><li class="toc-section learning-objectives"><a href="#m59788-fs-id1168047234384" class="target-section"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t">Learning Objectives</span></a></li><li class="toc-section"><a href="#m59788-fs-id1168047348458" class="target-section"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t">Lunar Phases</span></a></li><li class="toc-section"><a href="#m59788-fs-id1168047776425" class="target-section"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t">The Moon&#8217;s Revolution and Rotation</span></a></li></ul></div><div class="section learning-objectives" id="m59788-fs-id1168047234384"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 id="m59788-fs-id1168047234384"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated"/><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t">Learning Objectives</span></h3></div></div></div><p id="m59788-fs-id1168979537303"><span id="m59788-fs-id1168979537303"> </span>By the end of this section, you will be able to:</p><div class="itemizedlist" id="m59788-fs-id1168047357174"><span id="m59788-fs-id1168047357174"> </span><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p>Explain the cause of the lunar phases</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Understand how the Moon rotates and revolves around Earth</p></li></ul></div></div><p id="m59788-fs-id1168047719373"><span id="m59788-fs-id1168047719373"> </span>After the Sun, the <em class="glossterm no-emphasis" id="m59788-autoid-cnx2dbk-idm140481020308368"><span id="m59788-autoid-cnx2dbk-idm140481020308368"> </span>Moon</em><a id="idm45983377715280" class="indexterm"/> is the brightest and most obvious object in the sky.

The Moon, on the other hand, moves completely around Earth in that time. As we watch the Moon from our vantage point on Earth, how much of its face we see illuminated by sunlight depends on the angle the Sun makes with the Moon.</p><p id="m59788-fs-id1168047345619"><span id="m59788-fs-id1168047345619"> </span>Here is a simple experiment to show you what we mean: stand about 6 feet in front of a bright electric light in a completely dark room (or outdoors at night) and hold in your hand a small round object such as a tennis ball or an orange. Your head can then represent Earth, the light represents the Sun, and the ball the Moon. Move the ball around your head (making sure you don&#8217;t cause an eclipse by blocking the light with your head). You will see phases just like those of the Moon on the ball. (Another good way to get acquainted with the phases and motions of the Moon is to follow our satellite in the sky for a month or two, recording its shape, its direction from the Sun, and when it rises and sets.)</p><p id="m59788-fs-id1168047331555"><span id="m59788-fs-id1168047331555"> </span>Let&#8217;s examine the Moon&#8217;s cycle of phases using <a class="xref target-figure" href="ch04.html#m59788-OSC_Astro_04_05_Moon" title="Figure&#160;4.14.&#160;Phases of the Moon.">Figure&#160;4.14</a>, which depicts the Moon&#8217;s behavior for the entire month.

Here, its illuminated (bright) side is turned away from us and its dark side is turned toward us. You might say that the Sun is shining on the &#8220;wrong &#8221; side of the Moon from our perspective. In this phase the Moon is invisible to us; its dark, rocky surface does not give off any light of its own. Because the new moon is in the same part of the sky as the Sun, it rises at sunrise and sets at sunset.</p><p id="m59788-fs-id1168047201118"><span id="m59788-fs-id1168047201118"> </span>But the Moon does not remain in this phase long because it moves eastward each day in its monthly path around us. Since it takes about 30 days to orbit Earth and there are 360&#176; in a circle, the Moon will move about 12&#176; in the sky each day (or about 24 times its own diameter). A day or two after the new phase, the thin <span class="emphasis"><em>crescent</em></span> first appears, as we begin to see a small part of the Moon&#8217;s illuminated hemisphere. It has moved into a position where it now reflects a little sunlight toward us along one side. The bright crescent increases in size on successive days as the Moon moves farther and farther around the sky away from the direction of the Sun (position B). Because the Moon is moving eastward away from the Sun, it rises later and later each day (like a student during summer vacation).</p><p id="m59788-fs-id1168047719254"><span id="m59788-fs-id1168047719254"> </span>After about one week, the Moon is one-quarter of the way around its orbit (position C) and so we say it is at the <span class="emphasis"><em>first quarter</em></span> phase. Half of the Moon&#8217;s illuminated side is visible to Earth observers. Because of its eastward motion, the Moon now lags about one-quarter of the day behind the Sun, rising around noon and setting around midnight.</p><p id="m59788-fs-id1168047710452"><span id="m59788-fs-id1168047710452"> </span>During the week after the first quarter phase, we see more and more of the Moon&#8217;s illuminated hemisphere (position D), a phase that is called <span class="emphasis"><em>waxing</em></span> (or growing) gibbous (from the Latin <span class="emphasis"><em>gibbus</em></span>, meaning hump). Eventually, the Moon arrives at position E in our figure, where it and the Sun are opposite each other in the sky. The side of the Moon turned toward the Sun is also turned toward Earth, and we have the <span class="emphasis"><em>full</em></span> phase.</p><p id="m59788-fs-id1168047710722"><span id="m59788-fs-id1168047710722"> </span>When the Moon is full, it is opposite the Sun in the sky. The Moon does the opposite of what the Sun does, rising at sunset and setting at sunrise. Note what that means in practice: the completely illuminated (and thus very noticeable) Moon rises just as it gets dark, remains in the sky all night long, and sets as the Sun&#8217;s first rays are seen at dawn. Its illumination throughout the night helps lovers on a romantic stroll and students finding their way back to their dorms after a long night in the library or an off-campus party.</p><p id="m59788-fs-id1168047973727"><span id="m59788-fs-id1168047973727"> </span>And when is the full moon highest in the sky and most noticeable? At midnight, a time made famous in generations of horror novels and films. (Note how the behavior of a vampire like Dracula parallels the behavior of the full Moon: Dracula rises at sunset, does his worst mischief at midnight, and must be back down in his coffin by sunrise. The old legends were a way of personifying the behavior of the Moon, which was a much more dramatic part of people&#8217;s lives in the days before electric lights and television.)</p><p id="m59788-fs-id1168047645541"><span id="m59788-fs-id1168047645541"> </span>Folklore has it that more crazy behavior is seen during the time of the full moon (the Moon even gives a name to crazy behavior&#8212;&#8220;lunacy&#8221;). But, in fact, statistical tests of this &#8220;hypothesis&#8221; involving thousands of records from hospital emergency rooms and police files do not reveal any correlation of human behavior with the phases of the Moon. For example, homicides occur at the same rate during the new moon or the crescent moon as during the full moon. Most investigators believe that the real story is not that more crazy behavior happens on nights with a full moon, but rather that we are more likely to notice or remember such behavior with the aid of a bright celestial light that is up all night long.</p><p id="m59788-fs-id1168047383536"><span id="m59788-fs-id1168047383536"> </span>During the two weeks following the full moon, the Moon goes through the same phases again in reverse order (points F, G, and H in <a class="xref target-figure" href="ch04.html#m59788-OSC_Astro_04_05_Moon" title="Figure&#160;4.14.&#160;Phases of the Moon.">Figure&#160;4.14</a>), returning to new phase after about 29.5 days. About a week after the full moon, for example, the Moon is at <span class="emphasis"><em>third quarter</em></span>, meaning that it is three-quarters of the way around (not that it is three-quarters illuminated&#8212;in fact, half of the visible side of the Moon is again dark). At this phase, the Moon is now rising around midnight and setting around noon.</p><p id="m59788-fs-id1168047580350"><span id="m59788-fs-id1168047580350"> </span>Note that there is one thing quite misleading about <a class="xref target-figure" href="ch04.html#m59788-OSC_Astro_04_05_Moon" title="Figure&#160;4.14.&#160;Phases of the Moon.">Figure&#160;4.14</a>. If you look at the Moon in position E, although it is full in theory, it appears as if its illumination would in fact be blocked by a big fat Earth, and hence we would not see anything on the Moon except Earth&#8217;s shadow. In reality, the Moon is nowhere near as close to Earth (nor is its path so identical with the Sun&#8217;s in the sky) as this diagram (and the diagrams in most textbooks) might lead you to believe.</p><p id="m59788-fs-id1168047201041"><span id="m59788-fs-id1168047201041"> </span>The Moon is actually 30 <span class="emphasis"><em>Earth-diameters</em></span> away from us; <a class="link target-chapter" href="ch01.html#m59743" title="1..&#160;Introduction">Science and the Universe: A Brief Tour</a> contains a diagram that shows the two objects to scale.

The back side is dark no more frequently than the front side. Since the Moon rotates, the Sun rises and sets on all sides of the Moon. With apologies to Pink Floyd, there is simply no regular &#8220;Dark Side of the Moon.&#8221;</p></div></div><div xml:lang="en" class="section module" id="m59789"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 id="m59789"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated"/><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-n">4.6</span><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated">.&#160;</span><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t">Ocean Tides and the Moon<sup><a href="co03.html#book-attribution-m59789">*</a></sup></span></h2></div><div class="abstract"><div class="title"><span><span class="cnx-gentext-abstract cnx-gentext-autogenerated"/><span class="cnx-gentext-abstract cnx-gentext-t"/></span></div><p/></div></div></div><div class="toc"><ul><li class="toc-section learning-objectives"><a href="#m59789-fs-id1168047369517" class="target-section"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t">Learning Objectives</span></a></li><li class="toc-section"><a href="#m59789-fs-id1168047642036" class="target-section"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t">The Pull of the Moon on Earth</span></a></li><li class="toc-section"><a href="#m59789-fs-id1168047531702" class="target-section"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t">The Formation of Tides</span></a></li></ul></div><div class="section learning-objectives" id="m59789-fs-id1168047369517"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 id="m59789-fs-id1168047369517"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated"/><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t">Learning Objectives</span></h3></div></div></div><p id="m59789-fs-id1168977221271"><span id="m59789-fs-id1168977221271"> </span>By the end of this section, you will be able to:</p><div class="itemizedlist" id="m59789-fs-id1168047248878"><span id="m59789-fs-id1168047248878"> </span><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p>Describe what causes tides on Earth</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Explain why the amplitude of tides changes during the course of a month</p></li></ul></div></div><p id="m59789-fs-id1168047343161"><span id="m59789-fs-id1168047343161"> </span>Anyone living near the sea is familiar with the twice-daily rising and falling of the <em class="glossterm" id="m59789-autoid-cnx2dbk-idm140481007474912"><span id="m59789-autoid-cnx2dbk-idm140481007474912"> </span>tides</em><a id="idm45983377609984" class="indexterm"/>.

However, the presence of land masses stopping the flow of water, the friction in the oceans and between oceans and the ocean floors, the rotation of Earth, the wind, the variable depth of the ocean, and other factors all complicate the picture. This is why, in the real world, some places have very small tides while in other places huge tides become tourist attractions. If you have been in such places, you may know that &#8220;tide tables&#8221; need to be computed and published for each location; one set of tide predictions doesn&#8217;t work for the whole planet.

As it moves farther away, it will orbit less quickly (just as planets farther from the Sun move more slowly in their orbits). Thus, the month will get longer. Also, because the Moon will be more distant, total eclipses of the Sun will no longer be visible from Earth.</p><p id="m59789-fs-id1168047567835"><span id="m59789-fs-id1168047567835"> </span>Both the day and the month will continue to get longer, although bear in mind that the effects are very gradual.

These show that the Moon is moving away by 3.8 centimeters per year, and that ultimately&#8212;billions of years in the future&#8212;the day and the month will be the same length (about 47 of our present days). At this point the Moon will be stationary in the sky over the same spot on Earth, meaning some parts of Earth will see the Moon and its phases and other parts will never see them. This kind of alignment is already true for Pluto&#8217;s moon Charon (among others).

A solar eclipse starts when the Moon just begins to silhouette itself against the edge of the Sun&#8217;s disk. A partial phase follows, during which more and more of the Sun is covered by the Moon. About an hour after the eclipse begins, the Sun becomes completely hidden behind the Moon. In the few minutes immediately before this period of totality begins, the sky noticeably darkens, some flowers close up, and chickens may go to roost. As an eerie twilight suddenly descends during the day, other animals (and people) may get disoriented. During totality, the sky is dark enough that planets become visible in the sky, and usually the brighter stars do as well.</p><p id="m59790-fs-id1168047700912"><span id="m59790-fs-id1168047700912"> </span>As the bright disk of the Sun becomes entirely hidden behind the Moon, the Sun&#8217;s remarkable corona flashes into view (<a class="xref target-figure" href="ch04.html#m59790-OSC_Astro_04_07_Corona" title="Figure&#160;4.23.&#160;The Sun&#8217;s Corona.">Figure&#160;4.23</a>).

The Moon is opposite the Sun, which means the Moon will be in full phase before the eclipse, making the darkening even more dramatic. About 20 minutes before the Moon reaches the dark shadow, it dims somewhat as Earth partly blocks the sunlight. As the Moon begins to dip into the shadow, the curved shape of Earth&#8217;s shadow upon it soon becomes apparent.</p><p id="m59790-fs-id1168047218446"><span id="m59790-fs-id1168047218446"> </span>Even when totally eclipsed, the Moon is still faintly visible, usually appearing a dull coppery red.

The total duration of the eclipse depends on how closely the Moon&#8217;s path approaches the axis of the shadow. For an eclipse where the Moon goes through the center of Earth&#8217;s shadow, each partial phase consumes at least 1 hour, and totality can last as long as 1 hour and 40 minutes. Eclipses of the Moon are much more &#8220;democratic&#8221; than solar eclipses. Since the full moon is visible on the entire night side of Earth, the lunar eclipse is visible for all those who live in that hemisphere. (Recall that a total eclipse of the Sun is visible only in a narrow path where the shadow of the umbra falls.) Total eclipses of the Moon occur, on average, about once every two or three years. A list of future total eclipses of the Moon is in <a class="link target-chapter" href="aph.html" title="Appendix&#160;H.&#160;Future Total Eclipses">Appendix H</a>.

However, it is extremely dangerous to look directly at the Sun: even a brief exposure can damage your eyes. Normally, few rational people are tempted to do this because it is painful (and something your mother told you never to do!). But during the partial phases of a solar eclipse, the temptation to take a look is strong. Think before you give in. The fact that the Moon is covering part of the Sun doesn&#8217;t make the uncovered part any less dangerous to look at. Still, there are perfectly safe ways to follow the course of a solar eclipse, if you are lucky enough to be in the path of the shadow.</p><p id="m59790-fs-id1168047975092"><span id="m59790-fs-id1168047975092"> </span>The easiest technique is to make a pinhole projector. Take a piece of cardboard with a small (1 millimeter) hole punched in it, and hold it several feet above a light surface, such as a concrete sidewalk or a white sheet of paper, so that the hole is &#8220;aimed&#8221; at the Sun. The hole produces a fuzzy but adequate image of the eclipsed Sun. Alternatively, if it&#8217;s the right time of year, you can let the tiny spaces between a tree&#8217;s leaves form multiple pinhole images against a wall or sidewalk. Watching hundreds of little crescent Suns dancing in the breeze can be captivating. A kitchen colander also makes an excellent pinhole projector.</p><p id="m59790-fs-id1168047134108"><span id="m59790-fs-id1168047134108"> </span>Although there are safe filters for looking at the Sun directly, people have suffered eye damage by looking through improper filters, or no filter at all. For example, neutral density photographic filters are not safe because they transmit infrared radiation that can cause severe damage to the retina. Also unsafe are smoked glass, completely exposed color film, sunglasses, and many other homemade filters. Safe filters include welders&#8217; goggles and specially designed eclipse glasses.</p><p id="m59790-fs-id1168047239780"><span id="m59790-fs-id1168047239780"> </span>You should certainly look at the Sun directly when it is totally eclipsed, even through binoculars or telescopes. Unfortunately, the total phase, as we discussed, is all too brief. But if you know when it is coming and going, be sure you look, for it&#8217;s an unforgettably beautiful sight. And, despite the ancient folklore that presents eclipses as dangerous times to be outdoors, the partial phases of eclipses&#8212;as long as you are not looking directly at the Sun&#8212;are not any more dangerous than being out in sunlight.</p><p id="m59790-fs-id1168047344425"><span id="m59790-fs-id1168047344425"> </span>During past eclipses, unnecessary panic has been created by uninformed public officials acting with the best intentions.

An analogous celestial coordinate system is called right ascension (RA) and declination, with 0&#176; of declination starting at the vernal equinox.

At the summer solstice, the Sun is higher in the sky and its rays strike Earth more directly. The Sun is in the sky for more than half of the day and can heat Earth longer. At the winter solstice, the Sun is low in the sky and its rays come in at more of an angle; in addition, it is up for fewer than 12 hours, so those rays have less time to heat. At the vernal and autumnal equinoxes, the Sun is on the celestial equator and we get about 12 hours of day and night.

A solar eclipse occurs when the Moon moves between the Sun and Earth, casting its shadow on a part of Earth&#8217;s surface. If the eclipse is total, the light from the bright disk of the Sun is completely blocked, and the solar atmosphere (the corona) comes into view. Solar eclipses take place rarely in any one location, but they are among the most spectacular sights in nature. A lunar eclipse takes place when the Moon moves into Earth&#8217;s shadow; it is visible (weather permitting) from the entire night hemisphere of Earth.</p></div></div></div><!--CNX: Start Area: "For Further Exploration"--><div class="cnx-eoc further-exploration"><div class="title"><span>For Further Exploration</span></div><div class="section empty"><div class="title"><a href="#m59781"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated"/><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-n">4.</span><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated">.&#160;</span><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t">Thinking Ahead</span></a></div><div class="body"/></div><div class="section empty"><div class="title"><a href="#m59783"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated"/><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-n">4.1</span><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated">.&#160;</span><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t">Earth and Sky</span></a></div><div class="body"/></div><div class="section empty"><div class="title"><a href="#m59785"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated"/><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-n">4.2</span><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated">.&#160;</span><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t">The Seasons</span></a></div><div class="body"/></div><div class="section empty"><div class="title"><a href="#m59786"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated"/><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-n">4.3</span><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated">.&#160;</span><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t">Keeping Time</span></a></div><div class="body"/></div><div class="section empty"><div class="title"><a href="#m59787"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated"/><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-n">4.4</span><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated">.&#160;</span><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t">The Calendar</span></a></div><div class="body"/></div><div class="section empty"><div class="title"><a href="#m59788"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated"/><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-n">4.5</span><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated">.&#160;</span><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t">Phases and Motions of the Moon</span></a></div><div class="body"/></div><div class="section empty"><div class="title"><a href="#m59789"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated"/><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-n">4.6</span><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated">.&#160;</span><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t">Ocean Tides and the Moon</span></a></div><div class="body"/></div><div class="section"><div class="title"><a href="#m59790"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated"/><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-n">4.7</span><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated">.&#160;</span><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t">Eclipses of the Sun and Moon</span></a></div><div class="body"><div class="section" id="m59790-fs-id1168047457267"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 id="m59790-fs-id1168047457267"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated"/><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t">Articles</span></h4></div></div></div><p id="m59790-fs-id1168047351068"><span id="m59790-fs-id1168047351068"> </span>Bakich, M. &#8220;Your Twenty-Year Solar Eclipse Planner.&#8221; <span class="emphasis"><em>Astronomy</em></span> (October 2008): 74.
