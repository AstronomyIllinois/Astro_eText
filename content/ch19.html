What is the most distant object we can see? These are among the most fundamental questions astronomers can ask. But just as babies must crawl before they can take their first halting steps, so too must we start with a more modest question: How far away are the stars? And even this question proves to be very hard to answer. After all, stars are mere points of light. Suppose you see a point of light in the darkness when you are driving on a country road late at night. How can you tell whether it is a nearby firefly, an oncoming motorcycle some distance away, or the porchlight of a house much farther down the road? It&#8217;s not so easy, is it? Astronomers faced an even more difficult problem when they tried to estimate how far away the stars are.</p><p id="m59902-fs-id1165720743960"><span id="m59902-fs-id1165720743960"> </span>In this chapter, we begin with the fundamental definitions of distances on Earth and then extend our reach outward to the stars.

Later, the requirements of commerce led to some standardization of such units, but each nation tended to set up its own definitions. It was not until the middle of the eighteenth century that any real efforts were made to establish a uniform, international set of standards.</p><div class="section" id="m59904-fs-id1165721190360"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 id="m59904-fs-id1165721190360"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated"/><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t">The Metric System</span></h3></div></div></div><p id="m59904-fs-id1165720865951"><span id="m59904-fs-id1165720865951"> </span>One of the enduring legacies of the era of the French emperor Napoleon is the establishment of the <span class="emphasis"><em>metric system</em></span> of units, officially adopted in France in 1799 and now used in most countries around the world. The fundamental metric unit of length is the <span class="emphasis"><em>meter</em></span>, originally defined as one ten-millionth of the distance along Earth&#8217;s surface from the equator to the pole. French astronomers of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries were pioneers in determining the dimensions of Earth, so it was logical to use their information as the foundation of the new system.</p><p id="m59904-fs-id1165721034203"><span id="m59904-fs-id1165721034203"> </span>Practical problems exist with a definition expressed in terms of the size of Earth, since anyone wishing to determine the distance from one place to another can hardly be expected to go out and re-measure the planet. Therefore, an intermediate standard meter consisting of a bar of platinum-iridium metal was set up in Paris. In 1889, by international agreement, this bar was defined to be exactly one meter in length, and precise copies of the original meter bar were made to serve as standards for other nations.</p><p id="m59904-fs-id1165720966523"><span id="m59904-fs-id1165720966523"> </span>Other units of length are derived from the <em class="glossterm no-emphasis" id="m59904-autoid-cnx2dbk-idm140481022697664"><span id="m59904-autoid-cnx2dbk-idm140481022697664"> </span>meter</em><a id="idm45983359569840" class="indexterm"/>.

As a result of improved technology for generating spectral lines of precisely known wavelengths (see the chapter on <a class="link target-chapter" href="ch05.html#m59791" title="5..&#160;Thinking Ahead">Radiation and Spectra</a>), the meter was redefined to equal 1,650,763.73 wavelengths of a particular atomic transition in the element krypton-86.

Put another way, a distance of <span class="emphasis"><em>one light-second</em></span> (the amount of space light covers in one second) is defined to be 299,792,458.6 meters. That&#8217;s almost 300 million meters that light covers in just one second; light really is <span class="emphasis"><em>very</em></span> fast!

A knowledge of the angles at A and B and the length of the baseline, AB, allows the triangle ABC to be solved for any of its dimensions&#8212;say, the distance AC or BC. The solution could be reached by constructing a scale drawing or by using trigonometry to make a numerical calculation. If the tree were farther away, the whole triangle would be longer and skinnier, and the parallax angle would be smaller. Thus, we have the general rule that the smaller the parallax, the more distant the object we are measuring must be.</p><p id="m59905-fs-id1165722053186"><span id="m59905-fs-id1165722053186"> </span>In practice, the kinds of baselines surveyors use for measuring distances on Earth are completely useless when we try to gauge distances in space.

Aristotle and others argued, however, that Earth could not be revolving about the Sun. If it were, they said, we would surely observe the parallax of the nearer stars against the background of more distant objects as we viewed the sky from different parts of Earth&#8217;s orbit (<a class="xref target-figure" href="ch19.html#m59905-OSC_Astro_19_02_Parallax" title="Figure&#160;19.6.&#160;Parallax.">Figure&#160;19.6</a>).

The problem was that they did not have tools to measure parallax shifts too small to be seen with the human eye. By the eighteenth century, when there was no longer serious doubt about Earth&#8217;s revolution, it became clear that the stars must be extremely distant. Astronomers equipped with telescopes began to devise instruments capable of measuring the tiny shifts of nearby stars relative to the background of more distant (and thus unshifting) celestial objects.</p><p id="m59905-fs-id1165721891569"><span id="m59905-fs-id1165721891569"> </span>This was a significant technical challenge, since, even for the nearest stars, parallax angles are usually only a fraction of a second of arc. Recall that one second of arc (arcsec) is an angle of only 1/3600 of a degree. A coin the size of a US quarter would appear to have a diameter of 1 arcsecond if you were viewing it from a distance of about 5 kilometers (3 miles). Think about how small an angle that is.

For nearby stars, we can measure the apparent shift in their positions as Earth orbits the Sun. We wrote earlier that an object must be 206,265 AU distant to have a parallax of one second of arc. This must seem like a very strange number, but you can figure out why this is the right value. We will start by estimating the diameter of the Sun and then apply the same idea to a star with a parallax of 1 arcsecond. Make a sketch that has a round circle to represent the Sun, place Earth some distance away, and put an observer on it. Draw two lines from the point where the observer is standing, one to each side of the Sun. Sketch a circle centered at Earth with its circumference passing through the center of the Sun. Now think about proportions. The Sun spans about half a degree on the sky. A full circle has 360<sup>&#9675;</sup>.

The satellite was designed to make the most accurate parallax measurements in history, from 36,000 kilometers above Earth.

Hipparcos ended up spending its 4-year life in an elliptical orbit that varied from 500 to 36,000 kilometers high.

As discussed in <a class="link target-chapter" href="ch17.html#m59890" title="17.1.&#160;The Brightness of Stars">The Brightness of Stars</a>, our problem is that stars come in a bewildering variety of intrinsic luminosities. (If stars were light bulbs, we&#8217;d say they come in a wide range of wattages.) Suppose, instead, that all stars had the same &#8220;wattage&#8221; or luminosity. In that case, the more distant ones would always look dimmer, and we could tell how far away a star is simply by how dim it appeared. In the real universe, however, when we look at a star in our sky (with eye or telescope) and measure its apparent brightness, we cannot know whether it looks dim because it&#8217;s a low-wattage bulb or because it is far away, or perhaps some of each.</p><p id="m59906-fs-id1165720822841"><span id="m59906-fs-id1165720822841"> </span>Astronomers need to discover something else about the star that allows us to &#8220;read off&#8221; its intrinsic luminosity&#8212;in effect, to know what the star&#8217;s true wattage is. With this information, we can then attribute how dim it looks from Earth to its distance. Recall that the apparent brightness of an object decreases with the square of the distance to that object. If two objects have the same luminosity but one is three times farther than the other, the more distant one will look nine times fainter. Therefore, if we know the luminosity of a star and its apparent brightness, we can calculate how far away it is. Astronomers have long searched for techniques that would somehow allow us to determine the luminosity of a star&#8212;and it is to these techniques that we turn next.</p><div class="section" id="m59906-fs-id1165721082863"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 id="m59906-fs-id1165721082863"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated"/><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t">Variable Stars</span></h3></div></div></div><p id="m59906-fs-id1165720733257"><span id="m59906-fs-id1165720733257"> </span>The breakthrough in measuring distances to remote parts of our Galaxy, and to other galaxies as well, came from the study of <em class="glossterm no-emphasis" id="m59906-autoid-cnx2dbk-idm140481034419968"><span id="m59906-autoid-cnx2dbk-idm140481034419968"> </span>variable star</em><a id="idm45983358863088" class="indexterm"/>s.

Since the diagram plots luminosity versus temperature, this means we can now read off the star&#8217;s luminosity (once its spectrum has helped us place it on the diagram). As before, if we know how luminous the star really is and see how dim it looks, the difference allows us to calculate its distance. (For historical reasons, astronomers sometimes call this method of distance determination <span class="emphasis"><em>spectroscopic parallax</em></span>, even though the method has nothing to do with parallax.)</p><p id="m59907-fs-id1165719708044"><span id="m59907-fs-id1165719708044"> </span>The H&#8211;R diagram method allows astronomers to estimate distances to nearby stars, as well as some of the most distant stars in our Galaxy, but it is anchored by measurements of parallax. The distances measured using parallax are the gold standard for distances: they rely on no assumptions, only geometry. Once astronomers take a spectrum of a nearby star for which we also know the parallax, we know the luminosity that corresponds to that spectral type. Nearby stars thus serve as benchmarks for more distant stars because we can assume that two stars with identical spectra have the same intrinsic luminosity.</p></div><div class="section" id="m59907-fs-id1165720997828"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 id="m59907-fs-id1165720997828"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated"/><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t">A Few Words about the Real World</span></h3></div></div></div><p id="m59907-fs-id1165721118654"><span id="m59907-fs-id1165721118654"> </span>Introductory textbooks such as ours work hard to present the material in a straightforward and simplified way.

To make a good diagram, one needs to measure the characteristics and distances of many stars, which can be a time-consuming task. Since our own solar neighborhood is already well mapped, the stars astronomers most want to study to advance our knowledge are likely to be far away and faint. It may take hours of observing to obtain a single spectrum. Observers may have to spend many nights at the telescope (and many days back home working with their data) before they get their distance measurement. Fortunately, this is changing because surveys like Gaia will study billions of stars, producing public datasets that all astronomers can use.</p><p id="m59907-fs-id1165719776259"><span id="m59907-fs-id1165719776259"> </span>Despite these difficulties, the tools we have been discussing allow us to measure a remarkable range of distances&#8212;parallaxes for the nearest stars, RR Lyrae variable stars; the H&#8211;R diagram for clusters of stars in our own and nearby galaxies; and cepheids out to distances of 60 million light-years. <a class="xref target-table" href="ch19.html#m59907-fs-id1165720742736" title="Table&#160;19.1.&#160;">Table&#160;19.1</a> describes the distance limits and overlap of each method.</p><p id="m59907-fs-id1165720686757"><span id="m59907-fs-id1165720686757"> </span>Each technique described in this chapter builds on at least one other method, forming what many call the <span class="emphasis"><em>cosmic distance ladder</em></span>.

Half the shift in a nearby star&#8217;s position relative to very distant background stars, as viewed from opposite sides of Earth&#8217;s orbit, is called the parallax of that star and is a measure of its distance. The units used to measure stellar distance are the light-year, the distance light travels in 1 year, and the parsec (pc), the distance of a star with a parallax of 1 arcsecond (1 parsec = 3.26 light-years). The closest star, a red dwarf, is over 1 parsec away. The first successful measurements of stellar parallaxes were reported in 1838. Parallax measurements are a fundamental link in the chain of cosmic distances. The Hipparcos satellite has allowed us to measure accurate parallaxes for stars out to about 300 light-years, and the Gaia mission will result in parallaxes out to 30,000 light-years.</p></div></div><div class="section"><div class="title"><a href="#m59906"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated"/><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-n">19.3</span><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated">.&#160;</span><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t">Variable Stars: One Key to Cosmic Distances</span></a></div><div class="body"><p id="m59906-fs-id1165721070632"><span id="m59906-fs-id1165721070632"> </span>Cepheids and RR Lyrae stars are two types of pulsating variable stars. Light curves of these stars show that their luminosities vary with a regularly repeating period. RR Lyrae stars can be used as standard bulbs, and cepheid variables obey a period-luminosity relation, so measuring their periods can tell us their luminosities. Then, we can calculate their distances by comparing their luminosities with their apparent brightnesses, and this can allow us to measure distances to these stars out to over 60 million light-years.</p></div></div><div class="section"><div class="title"><a href="#m59907"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated"/><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-n">19.4</span><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated">.&#160;</span><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t">The H&#8211;R Diagram and Cosmic Distances</span></a></div><div class="body"><p id="m59907-fs-id1165720741062"><span id="m59907-fs-id1165720741062"> </span>Stars with identical temperatures but different pressures (and diameters) have somewhat different spectra. Spectral classification can therefore be used to estimate the luminosity class of a star as well as its temperature. As a result, a spectrum can allow us to pinpoint where the star is located on an H&#8211;R diagram and establish its luminosity. This, with the star&#8217;s apparent brightness, again yields its distance. The various distance methods can be used to check one against another and thus make a kind of distance ladder which allows us to find even larger distances.</p></div></div></div><!--CNX: Start Area: "For Further Exploration"--><div class="cnx-eoc further-exploration"><div class="title"><span>For Further Exploration</span></div><div class="section empty"><div class="title"><a href="#m59902"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated"/><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-n">19.</span><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated">.&#160;</span><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t">Thinking Ahead</span></a></div><div class="body"/></div><div class="section empty"><div class="title"><a href="#m59904"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated"/><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-n">19.1</span><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated">.&#160;</span><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t">Fundamental Units of Distance</span></a></div><div class="body"/></div><div class="section empty"><div class="title"><a href="#m59905"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated"/><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-n">19.2</span><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated">.&#160;</span><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t">Surveying the Stars</span></a></div><div class="body"/></div><div class="section empty"><div class="title"><a href="#m59906"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated"/><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-n">19.3</span><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated">.&#160;</span><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t">Variable Stars: One Key to Cosmic Distances</span></a></div><div class="body"/></div><div class="section"><div class="title"><a href="#m59907"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated"/><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-n">19.4</span><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated">.&#160;</span><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t">The H&#8211;R Diagram and Cosmic Distances</span></a></div><div class="body"><div class="section" id="m59907-fs-id1165720696965"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 id="m59907-fs-id1165720696965"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated"/><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t">Articles</span></h4></div></div></div><p id="m59907-fs-id1165720736485"><span id="m59907-fs-id1165720736485"> </span>Adams, A. &#8220;The Triumph of Hipparcos.&#8221; <span class="emphasis"><em>Astronomy</em></span> (December 1997): 60.

The two pointer stars at the ends of the bowl are 5.5&#176; apart. The two stars across the top of the bowl are 10&#176; apart. (Ten degrees is also about the width of your fist when held at arm&#8217;s length and projected against the sky.) Mizar, the second star from the end of the Big Dipper&#8217;s handle, appears double. The fainter star, Alcor, is about 12 arcmin from Mizar. For comparison, the diameter of the full moon is about 30 arcmin. The belt of Orion is about 3&#176; long.
