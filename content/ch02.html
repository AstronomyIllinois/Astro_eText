We can put an imaginary stick through Earth&#8217;s North and South Poles, representing our planet&#8217;s axis. It is because Earth turns on this axis every 24 hours that we see the Sun, Moon, and stars rise and set with clockwork regularity. Today, we know that these celestial objects are not really on a dome, but at greatly varying distances from us in space. Nevertheless, it is sometimes still convenient to talk about the celestial dome or sphere to help us keep track of objects in the sky. There is even a special theater, called a <span class="emphasis"><em>planetarium</em></span>, in which we project a simulation of the stars and planets onto a white dome.</p><p id="m59770-fs-id1170325053656"><span id="m59770-fs-id1170325053656"> </span>As the celestial sphere rotates, the objects on it maintain their positions with respect to one another. A grouping of stars such as the Big Dipper has the same shape during the course of the night, although it turns with the sky. During a single night, even objects we know to have significant motions of their own, such as the nearby planets, seem fixed relative to the stars. Only meteors&#8212;brief &#8220;shooting stars&#8221; that flash into view for just a few seconds&#8212;move appreciably with respect to other objects on the celestial sphere. (This is because they are not stars at all. Rather, they are small pieces of cosmic dust, burning up as they hit Earth&#8217;s atmosphere.)

The apparent motion of the celestial sphere depends on your latitude (position north or south of the equator). First of all, notice that Earth&#8217;s axis is pointing at the celestial poles, so these two points in the sky do not appear to turn.</p><p id="m59770-fs-id1170325055154"><span id="m59770-fs-id1170325055154"> </span>If you stood at the North Pole of Earth, for example, you would see the north celestial pole overhead, at your zenith. The celestial equator, 90&#176; from the celestial poles, would lie along your horizon. As you watched the stars during the course of the night, they would all circle around the celestial pole, with none rising or setting. Only that half of the sky north of the celestial equator is ever visible to an observer at the North Pole. Similarly, an observer at the South Pole would see only the southern half of the sky.</p><p id="m59770-fs-id1170324977733"><span id="m59770-fs-id1170324977733"> </span>If you were at Earth&#8217;s equator, on the other hand, you see the celestial equator (which, after all, is just an &#8220;extension&#8221; of Earth&#8217;s equator) pass overhead through your zenith. The celestial poles, being 90&#176; from the celestial equator, must then be at the north and south points on your horizon. As the sky turns, all stars rise and set; they move straight up from the east side of the horizon and set straight down on the west side. During a 24-hour period, all stars are above the horizon exactly half the time. (Of course, during some of those hours, the Sun is too bright for us to see them.)</p><p id="m59770-fs-id1170325085863"><span id="m59770-fs-id1170325085863"> </span>What would an observer in the latitudes of the United States or Europe see? Remember, we are neither at Earth&#8217;s pole nor at the equator, but in between them. For those in the continental United States and Europe, the north celestial pole is neither overhead nor on the horizon, but in between. It appears above the northern horizon at an angular height, or altitude, equal to the observer&#8217;s latitude. In San Francisco, for example, where the latitude is 38&#176; N, the north celestial pole is 38&#176; above the northern horizon.</p><p id="m59770-fs-id1170324959842"><span id="m59770-fs-id1170324959842"> </span>For an observer at 38&#176; N latitude, the south celestial pole is 38&#176; below the southern horizon and, thus, never visible.

They are always above the horizon, day and night.

One of the reasons for their conclusion was the thought that if Earth moved about the Sun, they would be observing the stars from different places along Earth&#8217;s orbit. As Earth moved along, nearby stars should shift their positions in the sky relative to more distant stars. In a similar way, we see foreground objects appear to move against a more distant background whenever we are in motion. When we ride on a train, the trees in the foreground appear to shift their position relative to distant hills as the train rolls by.

This indicated that the Sun was directly over the well&#8212;meaning that Syene was on a direct line from the center of Earth to the Sun. At the corresponding time and date in Alexandria, Eratosthenes observed the shadow a column made and saw that the Sun was not directly overhead, but was slightly south of the zenith, so that its rays made an angle with the vertical equal to about 1/50 of a circle (7&#176;). Because the Sun&#8217;s rays striking the two cities are parallel to one another, why would the two rays not make the same angle with Earth&#8217;s surface? Eratosthenes reasoned that the curvature of the round Earth meant that &#8220;straight up&#8221; was not the same in the two cities. And the measurement of the angle in Alexandria, he realized, allowed him to figure out the size of Earth. Alexandria, he saw, must be 1/50 of Earth&#8217;s circumference north of Syene (<a class="xref target-figure" href="ch02.html#m59763-OSC_Astro_02_02_Eratosthen" title="Figure&#160;2.11.&#160;How Eratosthenes Measured the Size of Earth.">Figure&#160;2.11</a>).

This diagram has two parts. The portion at right illustrates the apparent motion of Mars projected against the fixed background stars. The portion at left shows the Sun surrounded by two blue circles. The innermost circle represents the orbit of the Earth, the outermost the orbit of Mars. The Earth is shown as a blue dot in 5 positions, labeled A through E, along its orbit. Likewise, Mars is shown as a yellow dot in 5 positions, labeled A through E, along its orbit. Since the Earth travels faster than Mars, the 5 points for Earth are spread evenly around the circle of its orbit. As Mars moves more slowly, its 5 dots are all plotted close together on the right-hand side of its orbit. Beginning with Earth at point A on the lower left side of Earth&#8217;s orbit, an arrow connects with Mars at its point A at the lower right side of its orbit. This arrow continues and connects with Mars at point A near the bottom of its projected path of motion in the illustration at right. As Earth moves counter-clockwise along its orbit, it travels to point B at lower right, and Mars moves slightly upward on its orbit to its point B. An arrow points from Earth through Mars and continues on to connect with Mars at the third point B, which is above center on the projected path of motion. Thus, Mars has moved upward as seen from Earth in this figure. Earth then moves to point C at center-right on its orbit as does Mars. An arrow connects Earth through Mars to point C at the center of the projected path of motion. Mars has moved slightly downward as seen from Earth. Earth moves to point D at the upper right of its orbit and Mars moves upward to its point D. An arrow connects Earth through Mars and on to point D, which is below center on the projected path of motion. Mars has moved downward as seen from Earth. Finally, Earth moves to point E at the upper left of its orbit and Mars moves upward to its point E. An arrow connects Earth through Mars and on to point E near the top of its projected path of motion. Mars has moved upward as seen from Earth. In total, Mars has made a sideways &#8220;Z&#8221; shape in the sky as seen from Earth in this illustration."/></div></div><div class="title"><span class="cnx-gentext-figure cnx-gentext-autogenerated">Figure&#160;</span><span class="cnx-gentext-figure cnx-gentext-n">2.13</span><span class="cnx-gentext-figure cnx-gentext-autogenerated">.&#160;</span><span class="cnx-gentext-figure cnx-gentext-t">Retrograde Motion of a Planet beyond Earth&#8217;s Orbit.</span></div><div class="caption">The letters on the diagram show where Earth and Mars are at different times.

However, more than 2000 years have passed since the signs received their names from the constellations. Because of precession, the constellations of the zodiac slide westward along the ecliptic, going once around the sky in about 26,000 years. Thus, today the real stars have slipped around by about 1/12 of the zodiac&#8212;about the width of one sign.</p><p id="m59772-fs-id1170326285526"><span id="m59772-fs-id1170326285526"> </span>In most forms of astrology, however, the signs have remained assigned to the dates of the year they had when astrology was first set up.

However, as the celestial sphere turns (owing to the rotation of Earth), the entire zodiac moves across the sky to the west, completing a circuit of the heavens each day. Thus, the position in the sky (or &#8220;house&#8221; in astrology) must also be calculated. There are more or less standardized rules for the interpretation of the horoscope, most of which (at least in Western schools of astrology) are derived from the <span class="emphasis"><em>Tetrabiblos</em></span> of Ptolemy.

They cast horoscopes (a process much simplified by the development of appropriate computer programs) and suggest interpretations. Sun sign astrology (which you read in the newspapers and many magazines) is a recent, simplified variant of natal astrology. Although even professional astrologers do not place much trust in such a limited scheme, which tries to fit everyone into just 12 groups, sun sign astrology is taken seriously by many people (perhaps because it is discussed so commonly in the media).</p><p id="m59772-fs-id1170326449333"><span id="m59772-fs-id1170326449333"> </span>Today, we know much more about the nature of the planets as physical bodies, as well as about human genetics, than the ancients could. It is hard to imagine how the positions of the Sun, Moon, or planets in the sky at the moment of our birth could have anything to do with our personality or future. There are no known forces, not gravity or anything else, that could cause such effects. (For example, a straightforward calculation shows that the gravitational pull of the obstetrician delivering a newborn baby is greater than that of Mars.) Astrologers thus have to argue there must be unknown forces exerted by the planets that depend on their configurations with respect to one another and that do not vary according to the distance of the planet&#8212;forces for which there is no shred of evidence.</p><p id="m59772-fs-id1170326285978"><span id="m59772-fs-id1170326285978"> </span>Another curious aspect of astrology is its emphasis on planet configurations at birth. What about the forces that might influence us at conception? Isn&#8217;t our genetic makeup more important for determining our personality than the circumstances of our birth? Would we really be a different person if we had been born a few hours earlier or later, as astrology claims? (Back when astrology was first conceived, birth was thought of as a moment of magic significance, but today we understand a lot more about the long process that precedes it.)</p><p id="m59772-fs-id1170326323200"><span id="m59772-fs-id1170326323200"> </span>Actually, very few well-educated people today buy the claim that our entire lives are predetermined by astrological influences at birth, but many people apparently believe that astrology has validity as an indicator of affinities and personality. A surprising number of Americans make judgments about people&#8212;whom they will hire, associate with, and even marry&#8212;on the basis of astrological information. To be sure, these are difficult decisions, and you might argue that we should use any relevant information that might help us to make the right choices. But does astrology actually provide any useful information on human personality? This is the kind of question that can be tested using the scientific method (see <a class="link" href="ch02.html#m59772-fs-id1170326451942" title="Testing Astrology">Testing Astrology</a>).</p><p id="m59772-fs-id1170326284400"><span id="m59772-fs-id1170326284400"> </span>The results of hundreds of tests are all the same: there is no evidence that natal astrology has any predictive power, even in a statistical sense. Why, then, do people often seem to have anecdotes about how well their own astrologer advised them? Effective astrologers today use the language of the zodiac and the horoscope only as the outward trappings of their craft. Mostly they work as amateur therapists, offering simple truths that clients like or need to hear. (Recent studies have shown that just about any sort of short-term therapy makes people feel a little better because the very act of talking about our problems with someone who listens attentively is, in itself, beneficial.)</p><p id="m59772-fs-id1170326178646"><span id="m59772-fs-id1170326178646"> </span>The scheme of astrology has no basis in scientific fact, however; at best, it can be described as a pseudoscience. It is an interesting historical system, left over from prescientific days and best remembered for the impetus it gave people to learn the cycles and patterns of the sky. From it grew the science of astronomy, which is our main subject for discussion.</p><div id="m59772-fs-id1170326451942" class="note astronomy making-connections"><div class="title"><span class="cnx-gentext-tip-t">Testing Astrology</span></div><div class="body"><p id="m59772-fs-id1170326347948"><span id="m59772-fs-id1170326347948"> </span>In response to modern public interest in astrology, scientists have carried out a wide range of statistical tests to assess its predictive power. The simplest of these examine sun sign astrology to determine whether&#8212;as astrologers assert&#8212;some signs are more likely than others to be associated with some objective measure of success, such as winning Olympic medals, earning high corporate salaries, or achieving elective office or high military rank. (You can devise such a test yourself by looking up the birth dates of all members of Congress, for example, or all members of the U.S. Olympic team.) Are our political leaders somehow selected at birth by their horoscopes and thus more likely to be Leos, say, than Scorpios?</p><p id="m59772-fs-id1170326053838"><span id="m59772-fs-id1170326053838"> </span>You do not even need to be specific about your prediction in such tests. After all, many schools of astrology disagree about which signs go with which personality characteristics. To demonstrate the validity of the astrological hypothesis, it would be sufficient if the birthdays of all our leaders clustered in any one or two signs in some statistically significant way. Dozens of such tests have been performed, and all have come up completely negative: the birth dates of leaders in all fields tested have been found to be distributed randomly among <span class="emphasis"><em>all</em></span> the signs. Sun sign astrology does not predict anything about a person&#8217;s future occupation or strong personality traits.</p><p id="m59772-fs-id1170326160334"><span id="m59772-fs-id1170326160334"> </span>In a fine example of such a test, two statisticians examined the reenlistment records of the United States Marine Corps. We suspect you will agree that it takes a certain kind of personality not only to enlist, but also to reenlist in the Marines. If sun signs can predict strong personality traits&#8212;as astrologers claim&#8212;then those who reenlisted (with similar personalities) should have been distributed preferentially in those one or few signs that matched the personality of someone who loves being a Marine. However, the reenlisted were distributed randomly among all the signs.</p><p id="m59772-fs-id1170326177773"><span id="m59772-fs-id1170326177773"> </span>More sophisticated studies have also been done, involving full horoscopes calculated for thousands of individuals. The results of all these studies are also negative: none of the systems of astrology has been shown to be at all effective in connecting astrological aspects to personality, success, or finding the right person to love.</p><p id="m59772-fs-id1170326453935"><span id="m59772-fs-id1170326453935"> </span>Other tests show that it hardly seems to matter what a horoscope interpretation says, as long as it is vague enough, and as long as each subject feels it was prepared personally just for him or her. The French statistician Michel Gauquelin, for example, sent the horoscope interpretation for one of the worst mass murderers in history to 150 people, but told each recipient that it was a &#8220;reading&#8221; prepared exclusively for him or her. Ninety-four percent of the readers said they recognized themselves in the interpretation of the mass murderer&#8217;s horoscope.</p><p id="m59772-fs-id1170326212427"><span id="m59772-fs-id1170326212427"> </span>Geoffrey Dean, an Australian researcher, reversed the astrological readings of 22 subjects, substituting phrases that were the opposite of what the horoscope actually said. Yet, his subjects said that the resulting readings applied to them just as often (95%) as the people to whom the original phrases were given.</p></div></div><div id="m59772-fs-id1170326450635" class="note astronomy link-to-learning"><div class="title"><span class="cnx-gentext-tip-t"/></div><div class="body"><p id="m59772-fs-id1170326320393"><span id="m59772-fs-id1170326320393"> </span>For more on astrology and science from an astronomer&#8217;s point of view, read this <a class="link" href="https://openstaxcollege.org/l/30astrosociety">article</a> that shines light on the topic through an accessible Q&amp;A.</p></div></div></div></div><div xml:lang="en" class="section module" id="m59765"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 id="m59765"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated"/><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-n">2.4</span><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated">.&#160;</span><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t">The Birth of Modern Astronomy<sup><a href="co03.html#book-attribution-m59765">*</a></sup></span></h2></div><div class="abstract"><div class="title"><span><span class="cnx-gentext-abstract cnx-gentext-autogenerated"/><span class="cnx-gentext-abstract cnx-gentext-t"/></span></div><p/></div></div></div><div class="toc"><ul><li class="toc-section learning-objectives"><a href="#m59765-fs-id1170326330885" class="target-section"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t">Learning Objectives</span></a></li><li class="toc-section"><a href="#m59765-fs-id1170326077336" class="target-section"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t">Copernicus</span></a></li><li class="toc-section"><a href="#m59765-fs-id1170326077509" class="target-section"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t">The Heliocentric Model</span></a></li><li class="toc-section"><a href="#m59765-fs-id1170326133173" class="target-section"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t">Galileo and the Beginning of Modern Science</span></a></li><li class="toc-section"><a href="#m59765-fs-id1170326107084" class="target-section"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t">Galileo&#8217;s Astronomical Observations</span></a></li></ul></div><div class="section learning-objectives" id="m59765-fs-id1170326330885"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 id="m59765-fs-id1170326330885"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated"/><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t">Learning Objectives</span></h3></div></div></div><p id="m59765-fs-id1168980789001"><span id="m59765-fs-id1168980789001"> </span>By the end of this section, you will be able to:</p><div class="itemizedlist" id="m59765-fs-id1170326226142"><span id="m59765-fs-id1170326226142"> </span><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p>Explain how Copernicus developed the heliocentric model of the solar system</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Explain the Copernican model of planetary motion and describe evidence or arguments in favor of it</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Describe Galileo&#8217;s discoveries concerning the study of motion and forces</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Explain how Galileo&#8217;s discoveries tilted the balance of evidence in favor of the Copernican model</p></li></ul></div></div><p id="m59765-fs-id1170326036479"><span id="m59765-fs-id1170326036479"> </span>Astronomy made no major advances in strife-torn medieval Europe.

By this time, the old Ptolemaic system needed significant adjustments to predict the positions of the planets correctly. Copernicus wanted to develop an improved theory from which to calculate planetary positions, but in doing so, he was himself not free of all traditional prejudices.</p><p id="m59765-fs-id1170326293981"><span id="m59765-fs-id1170326293981"> </span>He began with several assumptions that were common in his time, such as the idea that the motions of the heavenly bodies must be made up of combinations of uniform circular motions. But he did not assume (as most people did) that Earth had to be in the center of the universe, and he presented a defense of the heliocentric system that was elegant and persuasive. His ideas, although not widely accepted until more than a century after his death, were much discussed among scholars and, ultimately, had a profound influence on the course of world history.</p><p id="m59765-fs-id1170326283032"><span id="m59765-fs-id1170326283032"> </span>One of the objections raised to the heliocentric theory was that if Earth were moving, we would all sense or feel this motion. Solid objects would be ripped from the surface, a ball dropped from a great height would not strike the ground directly below it, and so forth.

He also reasoned that the apparent rotation of the celestial sphere could be explained by assuming that Earth rotates while the celestial sphere is stationary. To the objection that if Earth rotated about an axis it would fly into pieces, Copernicus answered that if such motion would tear Earth apart, the still faster motion of the much larger celestial sphere required by the geocentric hypothesis would be even more devastating.</p></div><div class="section" id="m59765-fs-id1170326077509"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 id="m59765-fs-id1170326077509"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated"/><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t">The Heliocentric Model</span></h3></div></div></div><p id="m59765-fs-id1170326093672"><span id="m59765-fs-id1170326093672"> </span>The most important idea in Copernicus&#8217; <span class="emphasis"><em>De Revolutionibus</em></span> is that Earth is one of six (then-known) planets that revolve about the Sun. Using this concept, he was able to work out the correct general picture of the solar system. He placed the planets, starting nearest the Sun, in the correct order: Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn. Further, he deduced that the nearer a planet is to the Sun, the greater its orbital speed. With his theory, he was able to explain the complex retrograde motions of the planets without epicycles and to work out a roughly correct scale for the solar system.</p><p id="m59765-fs-id1170326396963"><span id="m59765-fs-id1170326396963"> </span>Copernicus could not prove that Earth revolves about the Sun. In fact, with some adjustments, the old Ptolemaic system could have accounted, as well, for the motions of the planets in the sky. But Copernicus pointed out that the Ptolemaic cosmology was clumsy and lacking the beauty and symmetry of its successor.</p><p id="m59765-fs-id1170326284307"><span id="m59765-fs-id1170326284307"> </span>In Copernicus&#8217; time, in fact, few people thought there were ways to prove whether the heliocentric or the older geocentric system was correct. A long philosophical tradition, going back to the Greeks and defended by the Catholic Church, held that pure human thought combined with divine revelation represented the path to truth. Nature, as revealed by our senses, was suspect. For example, Aristotle had reasoned that heavier objects (having more of the quality that made them heavy) must fall to Earth faster than lighter ones. This is absolutely incorrect, as any simple experiment dropping two balls of different weights shows. However, in Copernicus&#8217; day, experiments did not carry much weight (if you will pardon the expression); Aristotle&#8217;s reasoning was more convincing.</p><p id="m59765-fs-id1170326347838"><span id="m59765-fs-id1170326347838"> </span>In this environment, there was little motivation to carry out observations or experiments to distinguish between competing cosmological theories (or anything else). It should not surprise us, therefore, that the heliocentric idea was debated for more than half a century without any tests being applied to determine its validity. (In fact, in the North American colonies, the older geocentric system was still taught at Harvard University in the first years after it was founded in 1636.)</p><p id="m59765-fs-id1170326316767"><span id="m59765-fs-id1170326316767"> </span>Contrast this with the situation today, when scientists rush to test each new hypothesis and do not accept any ideas until the results are in. For example, when two researchers at the University of Utah announced in 1989 that they had discovered a way to achieve nuclear fusion (the process that powers the stars) at room temperature, other scientists at more than 25 laboratories around the United States attempted to duplicate &#8220;cold fusion&#8221; within a few weeks&#8212;without success, as it turned out. The cold fusion theory soon went down in flames.</p><p id="m59765-fs-id1170326205471"><span id="m59765-fs-id1170326205471"> </span>How would we look at Copernicus&#8217; model today? When a new hypothesis or theory is proposed in science, it must first be checked for consistency with what is already known.

The next step is to determine which predictions the new hypothesis makes that differ from those of competing ideas.

It was familiar to all persons then, as it is to us now, that if something is at rest, it tends to remain at rest and requires some outside influence to start it in motion. Rest was thus generally regarded as the natural state of matter. Galileo showed, however, that rest is no more natural than motion.</p><p id="m59765-fs-id1170326325539"><span id="m59765-fs-id1170326325539"> </span>If an object is slid along a rough horizontal floor, it soon comes to rest because friction between it and the floor acts as a retarding force. However, if the floor and the object are both highly polished, the object, given the same initial speed, will slide farther before stopping. On a smooth layer of ice, it will slide farther still. Galileo reasoned that if all resisting effects could be removed, the object would continue in a steady state of motion indefinitely. He argued that a force is required not only to start an object moving from rest but also to slow down, stop, speed up, or change the direction of a moving object. You will appreciate this if you have ever tried to stop a rolling car by leaning against it, or a moving boat by tugging on a line.</p><p id="m59765-fs-id1170326118511"><span id="m59765-fs-id1170326118511"> </span><em class="glossterm no-emphasis" id="m59765-autoid-cnx2dbk-idm140480990458384"><span id="m59765-autoid-cnx2dbk-idm140480990458384"> </span>Galileo</em><a id="idm45983379966720" class="indexterm"/> also studied the way objects <em class="glossterm" id="m59765-autoid-cnx2dbk-idm140480990457696"><span id="m59765-autoid-cnx2dbk-idm140480990457696"> </span>accelerate</em><a id="idm45983379965088" class="indexterm"/>&#8212;change their speed or direction of motion. Galileo watched objects as they fell freely or rolled down a ramp. He found that such objects accelerate uniformly; that is, in equal intervals of time they gain equal increments in speed.

For generations, physics teachers had said that the place to try this experiment is somewhere where there is no air, such as the Moon.

In Roman Catholic Italy, this was not a popular philosophy, for Church authorities still upheld the ideas of Aristotle and Ptolemy, and they had powerful political and economic reasons for insisting that Earth was the center of creation. Galileo not only challenged this thinking but also had the audacity to write in Italian rather than scholarly Latin, and to lecture publicly on those topics. For him, there was no contradiction between the authority of the Church in matters of religion and morality, and the authority of nature (revealed by experiments) in matters of science. It was primarily because of Galileo and his &#8220;dangerous&#8221; opinions that, in 1616, the Church issued a prohibition decree stating that the Copernican doctrine was &#8220;false and absurd&#8221; and not to be held or defended.</p></div><div class="section" id="m59765-fs-id1170326107084"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 id="m59765-fs-id1170326107084"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated"/><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t">Galileo&#8217;s Astronomical Observations</span></h3></div></div></div><p id="m59765-fs-id1170326205272"><span id="m59765-fs-id1170326205272"> </span>It is not certain who first conceived of the idea of combining two or more pieces of glass to produce an instrument that enlarged images of distant objects, making them appear nearer.

There were obvious military advantages associated with a device for seeing distant objects.

Before using his telescope for astronomical observations, Galileo had to devise a stable mount and improve the optics. He increased the magnification to 30&#215;. Galileo also needed to acquire confidence in the telescope.</p><p id="m59765-fs-id1170326272858"><span id="m59765-fs-id1170326272858"> </span>At that time, human eyes were believed to be the final arbiter of truth about size, shape, and color. Lenses, mirrors, and prisms were known to distort distant images by enlarging, reducing, or inverting them, or spreading the light into a spectrum (rainbow of colors). Galileo undertook repeated experiments to convince himself that what he saw through the telescope was identical to what he saw up close. Only then could he begin to believe that the miraculous phenomena the telescope revealed in the heavens were real.</p><p id="m59765-fs-id1170326086881"><span id="m59765-fs-id1170326086881"> </span>Beginning his astronomical work late in 1609, Galileo found that many stars too faint to be seen with the unaided eye became visible with his telescope.

Initially, however, Galileo met with a great deal of opposition. The Roman Catholic Church, still reeling from the Protestant Reformation, was looking to assert its authority and chose to make an example of Galileo. He had to appear before the Inquisition to answer charges that his work was heretical, and he was ultimately condemned to house arrest. His books were on the Church&#8217;s forbidden list until 1836, although in countries where the Roman Catholic Church held less sway, they were widely read and discussed.

We see only half of this sphere at one time, limited by the horizon; the point directly overhead is our zenith. The Sun&#8217;s annual path on the celestial sphere is the ecliptic&#8212;a line that runs through the center of the zodiac, which is the 18-degree-wide strip of the sky within which we always find the Moon and planets. The celestial sphere is organized into 88 constellations, or sectors.</p></div></div><div class="section"><div class="title"><a href="#m59763"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated"/><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-n">2.2</span><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated">.&#160;</span><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t">Ancient Astronomy</span></a></div><div class="body"><p id="m59763-fs-id1170325210818"><span id="m59763-fs-id1170325210818"> </span>Ancient Greeks such as Aristotle recognized that Earth and the Moon are spheres, and understood the phases of the Moon, but because of their inability to detect stellar parallax, they rejected the idea that Earth moves. Eratosthenes measured the size of Earth with surprising precision. Hipparchus carried out many astronomical observations, making a star catalog, defining the system of stellar magnitudes, and discovering precession from the apparent shift in the position of the north celestial pole. Ptolemy of Alexandria summarized classic astronomy in his <span class="emphasis"><em>Almagest</em></span>; he explained planetary motions, including retrograde motion, with remarkably good accuracy using a model centered on Earth. This geocentric model, based on combinations of uniform circular motion using epicycles, was accepted as authority for more than a thousand years.</p></div></div><div class="section"><div class="title"><a href="#m59772"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated"/><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-n">2.3</span><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated">.&#160;</span><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t">Astrology and Astronomy</span></a></div><div class="body"><p id="m59772-fs-id1170326273622"><span id="m59772-fs-id1170326273622"> </span>The ancient religion of astrology, with its main contribution to civilization a heightened interest in the heavens, began in Babylonia. It reached its peak in the Greco-Roman world, especially as recorded in the <span class="emphasis"><em>Tetrabiblos</em></span> of Ptolemy. Natal astrology is based on the assumption that the positions of the planets at the time of our birth, as described by a horoscope, determine our future. However, modern tests clearly show that there is no evidence for this, even in a broad statistical sense, and there is no verifiable theory to explain what might cause such an astrological influence.</p></div></div><div class="section"><div class="title"><a href="#m59765"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated"/><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-n">2.4</span><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated">.&#160;</span><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t">The Birth of Modern Astronomy</span></a></div><div class="body"><p id="m59765-fs-id1170326242846"><span id="m59765-fs-id1170326242846"> </span>Nicolaus Copernicus introduced the heliocentric cosmology to Renaissance Europe in his book <span class="emphasis"><em>De Revolutionibus</em></span>. Although he retained the Aristotelian idea of uniform circular motion, Copernicus suggested that Earth is a planet and that the planets all circle about the Sun, dethroning Earth from its position at the center of the universe. Galileo was the father of both modern experimental physics and telescopic astronomy. He studied the acceleration of moving objects and, in 1610, began telescopic observations, discovering the nature of the Milky Way, the large-scale features of the Moon, the phases of Venus, and four moons of Jupiter. Although he was accused of heresy for his support of heliocentric cosmology, Galileo is credited with observations and brilliant writings that convinced most of his scientific contemporaries of the reality of the Copernican theory.</p></div></div></div><!--CNX: Start Area: "For Further Exploration"--><div class="cnx-eoc further-exploration"><div class="title"><span>For Further Exploration</span></div><div class="section empty"><div class="title"><a href="#m59769"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated"/><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-n">2.</span><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated">.&#160;</span><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t">Thinking Ahead</span></a></div><div class="body"/></div><div class="section empty"><div class="title"><a href="#m59770"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated"/><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-n">2.1</span><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated">.&#160;</span><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t">The Sky Above</span></a></div><div class="body"/></div><div class="section empty"><div class="title"><a href="#m59763"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated"/><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-n">2.2</span><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated">.&#160;</span><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t">Ancient Astronomy</span></a></div><div class="body"/></div><div class="section empty"><div class="title"><a href="#m59772"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated"/><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-n">2.3</span><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated">.&#160;</span><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t">Astrology and Astronomy</span></a></div><div class="body"/></div><div class="section"><div class="title"><a href="#m59765"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated"/><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-n">2.4</span><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated">.&#160;</span><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t">The Birth of Modern Astronomy</span></a></div><div class="body"><div class="section" id="m59765-fs-id1170326324344"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 id="m59765-fs-id1170326324344"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated"/><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t">Articles</span></h4></div></div></div><div class="section" id="m59765-fs-id1170326041727"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h5 id="m59765-fs-id1170326041727"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated"/><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t"><span class="emphasis"><em>Ancient Astronomy</em></span></span></h5></div></div></div><p id="m59765-fs-id1170326074955"><span id="m59765-fs-id1170326074955"> </span>Gingerich, O. &#8220;From Aristarchus to Copernicus.&#8221;
