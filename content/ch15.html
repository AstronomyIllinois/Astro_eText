How can there be weather in the vacuum of space? Yet space weather, which refers to changing conditions in space, is an active field of research and can have profound effects on Earth. We are all familiar with the ups and downs of weather on Earth, and how powerful storms can be devastating for people and vegetation. Although we are separated from the Sun by a large distance as well as by the vacuum of space, we now understand that great outbursts on the Sun (solar storms, in effect) can cause changes in the atmosphere and magnetic field of Earth, sometimes even causing serious problems on the ground. In this chapter, we will explore the nature of the Sun&#8217;s outer layers, the changing conditions and activity there, and the ways that the Sun affects Earth.</p><p id="m59876-fs-id1163976931867"><span id="m59876-fs-id1163976931867"> </span>By studying the Sun, we also learn much that helps us understand stars in general. The Sun is, in astronomical terms, a rather ordinary star&#8212;not unusually hot or cold, old or young, large or small. Indeed, we are lucky that the Sun is typical. Just as studies of Earth help us understand observations of the more distant planets, so too does the Sun serve as a guide to astronomers in interpreting the messages contained in the light we receive from distant stars. As you will learn, the Sun is dynamic, continuously undergoing change, balancing the forces of nature to keep itself in equilibrium. In this chapter, we describe the components of the Sun, how it changes with time, and how those changes affect Earth.</p></div><div xml:lang="en" class="section module" id="m59877"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 id="m59877"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated"/><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-n">15.1</span><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated">.&#160;</span><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t">The Structure and Composition of the Sun<sup><a href="co03.html#book-attribution-m59877">*</a></sup></span></h2></div><div class="abstract"><div class="title"><span><span class="cnx-gentext-abstract cnx-gentext-autogenerated"/><span class="cnx-gentext-abstract cnx-gentext-t"/></span></div><p/></div></div></div><div class="toc"><ul><li class="toc-section learning-objectives"><a href="#m59877-fs-id1163976959263" class="target-section"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t">Learning Objectives</span></a></li><li class="toc-section"><a href="#m59877-fs-id1163976795727" class="target-section"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t">Composition of the Sun&#8217;s Atmosphere</span></a></li><li class="toc-section"><a href="#m59877-fs-id1163973151895" class="target-section"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t">The Layers of the Sun beneath the Visible Surface</span></a></li><li class="toc-section"><a href="#m59877-fs-id1163976551951" class="target-section"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t">The Solar Photosphere</span></a></li><li class="toc-section"><a href="#m59877-fs-id1163976519543" class="target-section"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t">The Chromosphere</span></a></li><li class="toc-section"><a href="#m59877-fs-id1163973082619" class="target-section"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t">The Transition Region</span></a></li><li class="toc-section"><a href="#m59877-fs-id1163973350845" class="target-section"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t">The Corona</span></a></li><li class="toc-section"><a href="#m59877-fs-id1163976947985" class="target-section"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t">The Solar Wind</span></a></li></ul></div><div class="section learning-objectives" id="m59877-fs-id1163976959263"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 id="m59877-fs-id1163976959263"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated"/><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t">Learning Objectives</span></h3></div></div></div><p id="m59877-fs-id1168584135926"><span id="m59877-fs-id1168584135926"> </span>By the end of this section, you will be able to:</p><div class="itemizedlist" id="m59877-fs-id1163976477537"><span id="m59877-fs-id1163976477537"> </span><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p>Explain how the composition of the Sun differs from that of Earth</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Describe the various layers of the Sun and their functions</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Explain what happens in the different parts of the Sun&#8217;s atmosphere</p></li></ul></div></div><p id="m59877-fs-id1163976796355"><span id="m59877-fs-id1163976796355"> </span>The <em class="glossterm no-emphasis" id="m59877-autoid-cnx2dbk-idm140480988594896"><span id="m59877-autoid-cnx2dbk-idm140480988594896"> </span>Sun</em><a id="idm45983364316752" class="indexterm"/>, like all stars, is an enormous ball of extremely hot, largely ionized gas, shining under its own power.

About 73% of the Sun&#8217;s mass is hydrogen, and another 25% is helium. All the other chemical elements (including those we know and love in our own bodies, such as carbon, oxygen, and nitrogen) make up only 2% of our star. The 10 most abundant gases in the Sun&#8217;s visible surface layer are listed in <a class="xref target-table" href="ch15.html#m59877-fs-id1163976857720" title="Table&#160;15.2.&#160;">Table&#160;15.2</a>. Examine that table and notice that the composition of the Sun&#8217;s outer layer is very different from Earth&#8217;s crust, where we live. (In our planet&#8217;s crust, the three most abundant elements are oxygen, silicon, and aluminum.) Although not like our planet&#8217;s, the makeup of the Sun is quite typical of stars in general.</p><div class="table span-all" id="m59877-fs-id1163976857720"><table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" summary="A table titled &#8220;The Abundance of Elements in the Sun&#8221; with three columns and 11 rows.

Astronomers have found that it is the Sun&#8217;s <span class="emphasis"><em>dynamo</em></span> that generates the magnetic field. A dynamo is a machine that converts kinetic energy (i.e., the energy of motion) into electricity. On Earth, dynamos are found in power plants where, for example, the energy from wind or flowing water is used to cause turbines to rotate. In the Sun, the source of kinetic energy is the churning of turbulent layers of ionized gas within the Sun&#8217;s interior that we mentioned earlier. These generate electric currents&#8212;moving electrons&#8212;which in turn generate magnetic fields.</p><p id="m59878-fs-id1163974546353"><span id="m59878-fs-id1163974546353"> </span>Most solar researchers agree that the <em class="glossterm no-emphasis" id="m59878-autoid-cnx2dbk-idm140480992538656"><span id="m59878-autoid-cnx2dbk-idm140480992538656"> </span>solar dynamo</em><a id="idm45983363902880" class="indexterm"/> is located in the convection zone or in the interface layer between the convection zone and the radiative zone below it.

Researchers have not yet developed a generally accepted model that describes in detail the physical processes that control the solar cycle. Calculations do show that differential rotation (the idea that the Sun rotates at different rates at different latitudes) and convection just below the solar surface can twist and distort the magnetic fields. This causes them to grow and then decay, regenerating with opposite polarity approximately every 11 years. The calculations also show that as the fields grow stronger near solar maximum, they flow from the interior of the Sun toward its surface in the form of loops. When a large loop emerges from the solar surface, it creates regions of sunspot activity (<a class="xref target-figure" href="ch15.html#m59878-OSC_Astro_15_02_DiffRot" title="Figure&#160;15.17.&#160;Magnetic Field Lines Wind Up.">Figure&#160;15.17</a>).</p><div id="m59878-OSC_Astro_15_02_DiffRot" class="figure"><div class="body"><div class="mediaobject" id="m59878-fs-id1163974240693"><span id="m59878-fs-id1163974240693"> </span><img src="m59878/OSC_Astro_15_02_DiffRot.jpg" alt="A figure illustrating how the magnetic field lines on the sun wind up.

The leading sunspot coincides with one end of the loop and the trailing spot with the other end. Magnetic fields also hold the key to explaining why sunspots are cooler and darker than the regions without strong magnetic fields. The forces produced by the magnetic field resist the motions of the bubbling columns of rising hot gases. Since these columns carry most of the heat from inside the Sun to the surface by means of convection, and strong magnetic fields inhibit this convection, the surface of the Sun is allowed to cool. As a result, these regions are seen as darker, cooler sunspots.</p><p id="m59878-fs-id1163975413373"><span id="m59878-fs-id1163975413373"> </span>Beyond this general picture, researchers are still trying to determine why the magnetic fields are as large as they are, why the polarity of the field in each hemisphere flips from one cycle to the next, why the length of the solar cycle can vary from one cycle to the next, and why events like the Maunder Minimum occur.</p><div id="m59878-fs-id1163974568823" class="note astronomy link-to-learning"><div class="title"><span class="cnx-gentext-tip-t"/></div><div class="body"><p id="m59878-fs-id1163974266241"><span id="m59878-fs-id1163974266241"> </span>In this <a class="link" href="https://openstax.org/l/30MagField">video</a> solar scientist Holly Gilbert discusses the Sun&#8217;s magnetic field.</p></div></div></div></div><div xml:lang="en" class="section module" id="m59879"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 id="m59879"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated"/><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-n">15.3</span><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated">.&#160;</span><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t">Solar Activity above the Photosphere<sup><a href="co03.html#book-attribution-m59879">*</a></sup></span></h2></div><div class="abstract"><div class="title"><span><span class="cnx-gentext-abstract cnx-gentext-autogenerated"/><span class="cnx-gentext-abstract cnx-gentext-t"/></span></div><p/></div></div></div><div class="toc"><ul><li class="toc-section learning-objectives"><a href="#m59879-fs-id1163976652943" class="target-section"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t">Learning Objectives</span></a></li><li class="toc-section"><a href="#m59879-fs-id1163976873384" class="target-section"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t">Plages and Prominences</span></a></li><li class="toc-section"><a href="#m59879-fs-id1163973229343" class="target-section"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t">Flares and Coronal Mass Ejections</span></a></li><li class="toc-section"><a href="#m59879-fs-id1163976571304" class="target-section"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t">Active Regions</span></a></li></ul></div><div class="section learning-objectives" id="m59879-fs-id1163976652943"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 id="m59879-fs-id1163976652943"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated"/><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t">Learning Objectives</span></h3></div></div></div><p id="m59879-fs-id1168584026760"><span id="m59879-fs-id1168584026760"> </span>By the end of this section, you will be able to:</p><div class="itemizedlist" id="m59879-fs-id1163976961378"><span id="m59879-fs-id1163976961378"> </span><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p>Describe the various ways in which the solar activity cycle manifests itself, including flares, coronal mass ejections, prominences, and plages</p></li></ul></div></div><p id="m59879-fs-id1163976486238"><span id="m59879-fs-id1163976486238"> </span>Sunspots are not the only features that vary during a <em class="glossterm no-emphasis" id="m59879-autoid-cnx2dbk-idm140480989999824"><span id="m59879-autoid-cnx2dbk-idm140480989999824"> </span>solar cycle</em><a id="idm45983363859184" class="indexterm"/>.

Changes in Earth&#8217;s magnetic field due to CMEs can also cause surges in power lines large enough to burn out transformers and cause major power outages. For example, in 1989, parts of Montreal and Quebec Province in Canada were without power for up to 9 hours as a result of a major solar storm. Electrical outages due to CMEs are more likely to occur in North America than in Europe because North America is closer to Earth&#8217;s magnetic pole, where the currents induced by CMEs are strongest.</p><p id="m59884-fs-id1163974439859"><span id="m59884-fs-id1163974439859"> </span>Besides changing the orbits of satellites, CMEs can also distort the signals sent by them. These effects can be large enough to reduce the accuracy of GPS-derived positions so that they cannot meet the limits required for airplane systems, which must know their positions to within 160 feet. Such disruptions caused by CMEs have occasionally forced the Federal Aviation Administration to restrict flights for minutes or, in a few cases, even days.</p><p id="m59884-fs-id1163972089688"><span id="m59884-fs-id1163972089688"> </span>Solar storms also expose astronauts, passengers in high-flying airplanes, and even people on the surface of Earth to increased amounts of radiation. Astronauts, for example, are limited in the total amount of radiation to which they can be exposed during their careers. A single ill-timed solar outburst could end an astronaut&#8217;s career. This problem becomes increasingly serious as astronauts spend more time in space. For example, the typical <span class="emphasis"><em>daily</em></span> dose of radiation aboard the Russian Mir space station was equivalent to about eight chest X-rays. One of the major challenges in planning the human exploration of Mars is devising a way to protect astronauts from high-energy solar radiation.</p><p id="m59884-fs-id1163974245179"><span id="m59884-fs-id1163974245179"> </span>Advance warning of solar storms would help us minimize their disruptive effects. Power networks could be run at less than their full capacity so that they could absorb the effects of power surges. Communications networks could be prepared for malfunctions and have backup plans in place. Spacewalks could be timed to avoid major solar outbursts. Scientists are now trying to find ways to predict where and when flares and CMEs will occur, and whether they will be big, fast events or small, slow ones with little consequence for Earth.</p><p id="m59884-fs-id1163974264882"><span id="m59884-fs-id1163974264882"> </span>The strategy is to relate changes in the appearance of small, active regions and changes in local magnetic fields on the Sun to subsequent eruptions. However, right now, our predictive capability is still poor, and so the only real warning we have is from actually seeing CMEs and flares occur. Since a CME travels outward at about 500 kilometers per second, an observation of an eruption provides several days warning at the distance of Earth. However, the severity of the impact on Earth depends on how the magnetic field associated with the CME is oriented relative to Earth&#8217;s magnetic field. The orientation can be measured only when the CME flows past a satellite we have put up for this purpose.

This coincidence in time caused scientists to try to understand whether small changes in the Sun could affect the climate on Earth. There is clear evidence that it was unusually cold in Europe during part of the seventeenth century. The River Thames in London froze at least 11 times, ice appeared in the oceans off the coasts of southeast England, and low summer temperatures led to short growing seasons and poor harvests. However, whether and how changes on the Sun on this timescale influence Earth&#8217;s climate is still a matter of debate among scientists.</p><p id="m59884-fs-id1163975577923"><span id="m59884-fs-id1163975577923"> </span>Other small changes in climate like the Little Ice Age have occurred and have had their impacts on human history. For example, explorers from Norway first colonized Iceland and then reached Greenland by 986. From there, they were able to make repeated visits to the northeastern coasts of North America, including Newfoundland, between about 1000 and 1350. (The ships of the time did not allow the Norse explorers to travel all the way to North America directly, but only from Greenland, which served as a station for further exploration.)</p><p id="m59884-fs-id1163975350834"><span id="m59884-fs-id1163975350834"> </span>Most of Greenland is covered by ice, and the Greenland station was never self-sufficient; rather, it depended on imports of food and other goods from Norway for its survival. When a little ice age began in the thirteenth century, voyaging became very difficult, and support of the Greenland colony was no longer possible. The last-known contact with it was made by a ship from Iceland blown off course in 1410. When European ships again began to visit Greenland in 1577, the entire colony there had disappeared.</p><p id="m59884-fs-id1163974354878"><span id="m59884-fs-id1163974354878"> </span>The estimated dates for these patterns of migration follow what we know about solar activity. Solar activity was unusually high between 1100 and 1250, which includes the time when the first European contacts were made with North America. Activity was low from 1280 to 1340 and there was a little ice age, which was about the time regular contact with North America and between Greenland and Europe stopped.</p><p id="m59884-fs-id1163974404977"><span id="m59884-fs-id1163974404977"> </span>One must be cautious, however, about assuming that low sunspot numbers or variations in the Sun&#8217;s output of energy <span class="emphasis"><em>caused</em></span> the Little Ice Age. There is no satisfactory model that can explain how a reduction in solar activity might cause cooler temperatures on Earth. An alternative possibility is that the cold weather during the Little Ice Age was related to volcanic activity. Volcanoes can eject aerosols (tiny droplets or particles) into the atmosphere that efficiently reflect sunlight. Observations show, for example, that the Pinatubo eruption in 1991 ejected SO<sub>2</sub> aerosols into the atmosphere, which reduced the amount of sunlight reaching Earth&#8217;s surface enough to lower global temperatures by 0.4 &#176;C.</p><p id="m59884-fs-id1163974369078"><span id="m59884-fs-id1163974369078"> </span>Satellite data show that the energy output from the Sun during a <em class="glossterm no-emphasis" id="m59884-autoid-cnx2dbk-idm140480995764784"><span id="m59884-autoid-cnx2dbk-idm140480995764784"> </span>solar cycle</em><a id="idm45983363420624" class="indexterm"/> varies by only about 0.1%. We know of no physical process that would explain how such a small variation could cause global temperature changes. The level of solar activity may, however, have other effects. For example, although the Sun&#8217;s total energy output varies by only 0.1% during a solar cycle, its extreme ultraviolet radiation is 10 times higher at times of solar maximum than at solar minimum. This large variation can affect the chemistry and temperature structure of the upper atmosphere. One effect might be a reduction in the ozone layer and a cooling of the stratosphere near Earth&#8217;s poles. This, in turn, could change the circulation patterns of winds aloft and, hence, the tracks of storms. There is some recent evidence that variations in regional rainfall correlate better with solar activity than does the global temperature of Earth.

These, in turn, are surrounded by a number of layers that make up the solar atmosphere. In order of increasing distance from the center of the Sun, they are the photosphere, with a temperature that ranges from 4500 K to about 6800 K; the chromosphere, with a typical temperature of 10<sup>4</sup> K; the transition region, a zone that may be only a few kilometers thick, where the temperature increases rapidly from 10<sup>4</sup> K to 10<sup>6</sup> K; and the corona, with temperatures of a few million K. The Sun&#8217;s surface is mottled with upwelling convection currents seen as hot, bright granules. Solar wind particles stream out into the solar system through coronal holes. When such particles reach the vicinity of Earth, they produce auroras, which are strongest near Earth&#8217;s magnetic poles. Hydrogen and helium together make up 98% of the mass of the Sun, whose composition is much more characteristic of the universe at large than is the composition of Earth.</p></div></div><div class="section"><div class="title"><a href="#m59878"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated"/><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-n">15.2</span><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated">.&#160;</span><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t">The Solar Cycle</span></a></div><div class="body"><p id="m59878-fs-id1163971939494"><span id="m59878-fs-id1163971939494"> </span>Sunspots are dark regions where the temperature is up to 2000 K cooler than the surrounding photosphere. Their motion across the Sun&#8217;s disk allows us to calculate how fast the Sun turns on its axis. The Sun rotates more rapidly at its equator, where the rotation period is about 25 days, than near the poles, where the period is slightly longer than 36 days. The number of visible sunspots varies according to a sunspot cycle that averages 11 years in length. Spots frequently occur in pairs. During a given 11-year cycle, all leading spots in the Northern Hemisphere have the same magnetic polarity, whereas all leading sports in the Southern Hemisphere have the opposite polarity. In the subsequent 11-year cycle, the polarity reverses. For this reason, the magnetic activity cycle of the Sun is understood to last for 22 years. This activity cycle is connected with the behavior of the Sun&#8217;s magnetic field, but the exact mechanism is not yet understood.</p></div></div><div class="section"><div class="title"><a href="#m59879"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated"/><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-n">15.3</span><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated">.&#160;</span><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t">Solar Activity above the Photosphere</span></a></div><div class="body"><p id="m59879-fs-id1163976516234"><span id="m59879-fs-id1163976516234"> </span>Signs of more intense solar activity, an increase in the number of sunspots, as well as prominences, plages, solar flares, and <span class="bold"><strong>c</strong></span>oronal mass ejections, all tend to occur in active regions&#8212;that is, in places on the Sun with the same latitude and longitude but at different heights in the atmosphere.

The pupil of your eye is very small relative to the size of a telescope and therefore is very limited in the amount of detail you can see. In fact, your eye cannot see details that are smaller than 1/30 of the diameter of the Sun (about 1 arcminute). Nearly all the light from the Sun emerges from a layer that is only about 400 km thick. What fraction is this of the diameter of the Sun? How does this compare with the ability of the human eye to resolve detail?
