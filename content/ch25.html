In 1917, he was studying RR Lyrae variable stars in globular clusters. By comparing the known intrinsic luminosity of these stars to how bright they appeared, Shapley could calculate how far away they are. (Recall that it is distance that makes the stars look dimmer than they would be &#8220;up close,&#8221; and that the brightness fades as the distance squared.) Knowing the distance to any star in a cluster then tells us the distance to the cluster itself.</p><p id="m59948-fs-id1168047791576"><span id="m59948-fs-id1168047791576"> </span>Globular clusters can be found in regions that are free of interstellar dust and so can be seen at very large distances. When Shapley used the distances and directions of 93 globular clusters to map out their positions in space, he found that the clusters are distributed in a spherical volume, which has its center not at the Sun but at a distant point along the Milky Way in the direction of Sagittarius. Shapley then made the bold assumption, verified by many other observations since then, that the point on which the system of globular clusters is centered is also the center of the entire Galaxy (<a class="xref target-figure" href="ch25.html#m59948-OSC_Astro_25_01_Cluster" title="Figure&#160;25.4.&#160;Harlow Shapley and His Diagram of the Milky Way.">Figure&#160;25.4</a>).</p><div id="m59948-OSC_Astro_25_01_Cluster" class="figure"><div class="body"><div class="mediaobject" id="m59948-fs-id1168047345274"><span id="m59948-fs-id1168047345274"> </span><img src="m59948/OSC_Astro_25_01_Cluster.jpg" alt="Panel (a), at left: Photograph of Harlow Shapley.

He studied at home and at age 16 got a job as a newspaper reporter covering crime stories.

He wrote a series of nontechnical books and articles and became known as one of the most effective popularizers of astronomy.

And during the difficult period of the 1950s, when congressional committees began their &#8220;witch hunts&#8221; for communist sympathizers (including such liberal leaders as Shapley), he spoke out forcefully and fearlessly in defense of the freedom of thought and expression.

For example, the Milky Way somewhat resembles the Andromeda galaxy, which, at a distance of about 2.3 million light-years, is our nearest neighboring giant spiral galaxy.

The turbulence in these galaxies decreased, rotation began to dominate the motions of the stars and gas, and stars began to form in a much quieter disk. Smaller star-forming clumps began to form fuzzy, not-very-distinct spiral arms. Bright, well-defined spiral arms began to appear only when the galaxies were about 3.6 billion years old. Initially, there were two well-defined arms.

For our calculation, then, we can assume that all the mass that lies inward of the Sun&#8217;s position is concentrated at the center of the Galaxy, and that the Sun orbits that point from a distance of about 26,000 light-years.</p><p id="m59950-fs-id1168048747412"><span id="m59950-fs-id1168048747412"> </span>This is the sort of situation to which <em class="glossterm no-emphasis" id="m59950-autoid-cnx2dbk-idm140480993119632"><span id="m59950-autoid-cnx2dbk-idm140480993119632"> </span>Kepler</em><a id="idm45983351734784" class="indexterm"/>&#8217;s third law (as modified by Newton) can be directly applied.

Thus, for all practical purposes, the result (about 100 billion times the mass of the Sun) is the mass of the Milky Way.

Let&#8217;s look at a list of &#8220;suspects&#8221; taken from our study of astronomy so far. Since this matter is invisible, it clearly cannot be in the form of ordinary stars. And it cannot be gas in any form (remember that there has to be a lot of it). If it were neutral hydrogen gas, its 21-cm wavelength spectral-line emission would have been detected as radio waves. If it were ionized hydrogen, it should be hot enough to emit visible radiation. If a lot of hydrogen atoms out there had combined into hydrogen molecules, these should produce dark features in the ultraviolet spectra of objects lying beyond the Galaxy, but such features have not been seen. Nor can the dark matter consist of interstellar dust, since in the required quantities, the dust would significantly obscure the light from distant galaxies.</p><p id="m59950-fs-id1168048786300"><span id="m59950-fs-id1168048786300"> </span>What are our other possibilities?

Also, recall that the formation of black holes and neutron stars is preceded by a substantial amount of mass loss, which scatters heavy elements into space to be incorporated into subsequent generations of stars. If the dark matter consisted of an enormous number of any of those objects, they would have blown off and recycled a lot of heavier elements over the history of the Galaxy. In that case, the young stars we observe in our Galaxy today would contain much greater abundances of heavy elements than they actually do.</p><p id="m59950-fs-id1168048769876"><span id="m59950-fs-id1168048769876"> </span>Brown dwarfs and lone Jupiter-like planets have also been ruled out. First of all, there would have to be an awful lot of them to make up so much dark matter. But we have a more direct test of whether so many low-mass objects could actually be lurking out there. As we learned in <a class="link target-chapter" href="ch24.html#m59938" title="24..&#160;Thinking Ahead">Black Holes and Curved Spacetime</a>, the general theory of relativity predicts that the path traveled by light is changed when it passes near a concentration of mass. It turns out that when the two objects appear close enough together in the sky, the mass closer to us can bend the light from farther away. With just the right alignment, the image of the more distant object also becomes significantly brighter. By looking for the temporary brightening that occurs when a dark matter object in our own Galaxy moves across the path traveled by light from stars in the Magellanic Clouds, astronomers have now shown that the dark matter cannot be made up of a lot of small objects with masses between one-millionth and one-tenth the mass of the Sun.</p><p id="m59950-fs-id1168046116668"><span id="m59950-fs-id1168046116668"> </span>What&#8217;s left? One possibility is that the dark matter is composed of exotic subatomic particles of a type not yet detected on Earth. Very sophisticated (and difficult) experiments are now under way to look for such particles. Stay tuned to see whether anything like that turns up.</p><p id="m59950-fs-id1168048359478"><span id="m59950-fs-id1168048359478"> </span>We should add that the problem of dark matter is by no means confined to the Milky Way. Observations show that dark matter must also be present in other galaxies (whose outer regions also orbit too fast &#8220;for their own good&#8221;&#8212;they also have flat rotation curves). As we will see, dark matter even exists in great clusters of galaxies whose members are now known to move around under the influence of far more gravity than can be accounted for by luminous matter alone.</p><p id="m59950-fs-id1168048296911"><span id="m59950-fs-id1168048296911"> </span>Stop a moment and consider how astounding the conclusion we have reached really is.

That is a very short time compared with the age of the Galaxy, which probably began forming more than 13 billion years ago.

One possibility is that a large cloud of gas near the center of the Milky Way collapsed directly to form a black hole. Since we find large black holes at the centers of most other large galaxies (see <a class="link target-chapter" href="ch27.html#m59961" title="27..&#160;Thinking Ahead">Active Galaxies, Quasars, and Supermassive Black Holes</a>)&#8212;even ones that are very young&#8212;this collapse probably would have taken place when the Milky Way was just beginning to take shape. The initial mass of this black hole might have been only a few tens of solar masses. Another way it could have started is that a massive star might have exploded to leave behind a seed black hole, or a dense cluster of stars might have collapsed into a black hole.</p><p id="m59951-fs-id1168048486320"><span id="m59951-fs-id1168048486320"> </span>Once a black hole exists at the center of a galaxy, it can grow over the next several billion years by devouring nearby stars and gas clouds in the crowded central regions.

Stars are also on the black hole&#8217;s menu. The density of stars near the galactic center is high enough that we would expect a star to pass near the black hole and be swallowed by it every ten thousand years or so. As this happens, some of the energy of infall is released as radiation. As a result, the center of the Galaxy might flare up and even briefly outshine all the stars in the Milky Way. Other objects might also venture too close to the black hole and be pulled in. How great a flare we observe would depend on the mass of the object falling in.</p><p id="m59951-fs-id1168048388946"><span id="m59951-fs-id1168048388946"> </span>In 2013, the Chandra X-ray satellite detected a flare from the center of our Galaxy that was 400 times brighter than the usual output from Sagittarius A*. A year later, a second flare, only half as bright, was also detected. This is much less energy than swallowing a whole star would produce. There are two theories to account for the flares. First, an asteroid might have ventured too close to the black hole and been heated to a very high temperature before being swallowed up. Alternatively, the flares might have involved interactions of the magnetic fields near the galactic center in a process similar to the one described for solar flares (see <a class="link target-chapter" href="ch15.html#m59876" title="15..&#160;Thinking Ahead">The Sun: A Garden-Variety Star</a>).

But she was also drawn to ballet and to solving all sorts of puzzles. By high school, she had lost the ballet bug in favor of competing in field hockey, playing the flute, and digging deeper into academics. Her undergraduate years at MIT were punctuated by a number of changes in her major&#8212;from mathematics to chemistry, mechanical engineering, aerospace engineering, and finally physics&#8212;where she felt her options were most open. As a physics major, she became involved in astronomical research under the guidance of one of her instructors. Once she got to do some actual observing at Kitt Peak National Observatory in Arizona, and later at Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory in Chile, Ghez had found her calling.</p><p id="m59951-fs-id1168048303586"><span id="m59951-fs-id1168048303586"> </span>Pursuing her graduate studies at Caltech, she stuck with physics but oriented her efforts toward observational astrophysics, an area where Caltech had access to cutting-edge facilities. Though initially attracted to studying the black holes that were suspected of dwelling inside most massive galaxies, Ghez ended up spending most of her graduate study and later postdoctoral research at the University of Arizona studying stars in formation. By taking very high-resolution (detailed) imaging of regions where new stars are born, she discovered that most stars form as members of binary systems. As technologies advanced, she was able to track the orbits danced by these stellar pairings and thereby could ascertain their respective masses.</p><p id="m59951-fs-id1168048436904"><span id="m59951-fs-id1168048436904"> </span>Now an astronomy professor at UCLA, Ghez has since used similar high-resolution imaging techniques to study the orbits of stars in the innermost core of the Milky Way. These orbits take years to delineate, so Ghez and her science team have logged more than 20 years of taking super-resolution infrared images with the giant Keck telescopes in Hawaii. Based on the resulting stellar orbits, the UCLA Galactic Center Group has settled (as we saw) on a gravitational solution that requires the presence of a supermassive black hole with a mass equivalent to 4.6 million Suns&#8212;all nestled within a space smaller than that occupied by our solar system. Ghez&#8217;s achievements have been recognized with one of the &#8220;genius&#8221; awards given by the MacArthur Foundation. More recently, her team discovered glowing clouds of warm ionized gas that co-orbit with the stars but may be more vulnerable to the disruptive effects of the central black hole. By monitoring these clouds, the team hopes to better understand the evolution of supermassive black holes and their immediate environs. They also hope to test Einstein&#8217;s theory of general relativity by carefully scrutinizing the orbits of stars that careen closest to the intensely gravitating black hole.</p><p id="m59951-fs-id1168046016490"><span id="m59951-fs-id1168046016490"> </span>Besides her pioneering work as an astronomer, Ghez competes as a master swimmer, enjoys family life as a mother of two children, and actively encourages other women to pursue scientific careers.</p></div></div></div></div><div xml:lang="en" class="section module" id="m59952"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 id="m59952"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated"/><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-n">25.5</span><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated">.&#160;</span><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t">Stellar Populations in the Galaxy<sup><a href="co03.html#book-attribution-m59952">*</a></sup></span></h2></div><div class="abstract"><div class="title"><span><span class="cnx-gentext-abstract cnx-gentext-autogenerated"/><span class="cnx-gentext-abstract cnx-gentext-t"/></span></div><p/></div></div></div><div class="toc"><ul><li class="toc-section learning-objectives"><a href="#m59952-fs-id1168046019585" class="target-section"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t">Learning Objectives</span></a></li><li class="toc-section"><a href="#m59952-fs-id1168048358972" class="target-section"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t">Two Kinds of Stars</span></a></li><li class="toc-section"><a href="#m59952-fs-id1168046122947" class="target-section"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t">The Real World</span></a></li></ul></div><div class="section learning-objectives" id="m59952-fs-id1168046019585"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 id="m59952-fs-id1168046019585"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated"/><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t">Learning Objectives</span></h3></div></div></div><p id="m59952-fs-id1168584209585"><span id="m59952-fs-id1168584209585"> </span>By the end of this section, you will be able to:</p><div class="itemizedlist" id="m59952-fs-id1168048351836"><span id="m59952-fs-id1168048351836"> </span><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p>Distinguish between population I and population II stars according to their locations, motions, heavy-element abundances, and ages</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Explain why the oldest stars in the Galaxy are poor in elements heavier than hydrogen and helium, while stars like the Sun and even younger stars are typically richer in these heavy elements</p></li></ul></div></div><p id="m59952-fs-id1168046014883"><span id="m59952-fs-id1168046014883"> </span>In the first section of his chapter, we described the thin disk, thick disk, and stellar halo.

Population I stars are found only in the disk and follow nearly circular orbits around the galactic center. Examples are bright supergiant stars, main-sequence stars of high luminosity (spectral classes O and B), which are concentrated in the spiral arms, and members of young open star clusters. Interstellar matter and molecular clouds are found in the same places as population I stars.</p><p id="m59952-fs-id1168048485139"><span id="m59952-fs-id1168048485139"> </span>Population II stars show no correlation with the location of the spiral arms. These objects are found throughout the Galaxy. Some are in the disk, but many others follow eccentric elliptical orbits that carry them high above the galactic disk into the halo. Examples include stars surrounded by planetary nebulae and RR Lyrae variable stars. The stars in globular clusters, found almost entirely in the Galaxy&#8217;s halo, are also classified as population II.</p><p id="m59952-fs-id1168048747412"><span id="m59952-fs-id1168048747412"> </span>Today, we know much more about stellar evolution than astronomers did in the 1940s, and we can determine the ages of stars. Population I includes stars with a wide range of ages. While some are as old as 10 billion years, others are still forming today. For example, the Sun, which is about 5 billion years old, is a population I star. But so are the massive young stars in the Orion Nebula that have formed in the last few million years. Population II, on the other hand, consists entirely of old stars that formed very early in the history of the Galaxy; typical ages are 11 to 13 billion years.</p><p id="m59952-fs-id1168048345671"><span id="m59952-fs-id1168048345671"> </span>We also now have good determinations of the compositions of stars. These are based on analyses of the stars&#8217; detailed spectra. Nearly all stars appear to be composed mostly of hydrogen and helium, but their abundances of the heavier elements differ. In the Sun and other population I stars, the heavy elements (those heavier than hydrogen and helium) account for 1&#8211;4% of the total stellar mass. Population II stars in the outer galactic halo and in globular clusters have much lower abundances of the heavy elements&#8212;often less than one-hundredth the concentrations found in the Sun and in rare cases even lower. The oldest population II star discovered to date has less than one ten-millionth as much iron as the Sun, for example.</p><p id="m59952-fs-id1168048357747"><span id="m59952-fs-id1168048357747"> </span>As we discussed in earlier chapters, heavy elements are created deep within the interiors of stars. They are added to the Galaxy&#8217;s reserves of raw material when stars die, and their material is recycled into new generations of stars. Thus, as time goes on, stars are born with larger and larger supplies of heavy elements. Population II stars formed when the abundance of elements heavier than hydrogen and helium was low. Population I stars formed later, after mass lost by dying members of the first generations of stars had seeded the interstellar medium with elements heavier than hydrogen and helium. Some are still forming now, when further generations have added to the supply of heavier elements available to new stars.</p></div><div class="section" id="m59952-fs-id1168046122947"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 id="m59952-fs-id1168046122947"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated"/><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t">The Real World</span></h3></div></div></div><p id="m59952-fs-id1168048726161"><span id="m59952-fs-id1168048726161"> </span>With rare exceptions, we should never trust any theory that divides the world into just two categories.

The hottest young stars and their associated gas and dust clouds are mostly in a region about 300 light-years thick. Older stars define a thicker disk that is about 3000 light-years thick. Halo stars spend most of their time high above or below the disk but pass through it on their highly elliptical orbits and so are sometimes found relatively near the Sun.</p><p id="m59952-fs-id1168048375935"><span id="m59952-fs-id1168048375935"> </span>The highest density of stars is found in the central bulge, that bar-shaped inner region of the Galaxy. There are a few hot, young stars in the bulge, but most of the bulge stars are more than 10 billion years old.

After a few million years, the first generation of massive and short-lived stars then expelled heavy elements in supernova explosions and thereby enriched subsequent generations of stars. Thus, even stars that formed in the bulge more than 10 billion years ago started with a good supply of heavy elements.</p><p id="m59952-fs-id1168048418419"><span id="m59952-fs-id1168048418419"> </span>Exactly the opposite occurred in the <em class="glossterm no-emphasis" id="m59952-autoid-cnx2dbk-idm140481002389056"><span id="m59952-autoid-cnx2dbk-idm140481002389056"> </span>Small Magellanic Cloud</em><a id="idm45983351481264" class="indexterm"/>, a small galaxy near the Milky Way, visible from Earth&#8217;s Southern Hemisphere.

As a result there have been, so far, relatively few supernova explosions. Smaller galaxies also have more trouble holding onto the gas expelled by supernova explosions in order to recycle it. Low-mass galaxies exert only a modest gravitational force, and the high-speed gas ejected by supernovae can easily escape from them.</p><p id="m59952-fs-id1168048737486"><span id="m59952-fs-id1168048737486"> </span>Which elements a star is endowed with thus depends not only on when the star formed in the history of its galaxy, but also on how many stars in its part of the galaxy had already completed their lives by the time the star is ready to form.</p></div></div><div xml:lang="en" class="section module" id="m59955"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 id="m59955"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated"/><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-n">25.6</span><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated">.&#160;</span><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t">The Formation of the Galaxy<sup><a href="co03.html#book-attribution-m59955">*</a></sup></span></h2></div><div class="abstract"><div class="title"><span><span class="cnx-gentext-abstract cnx-gentext-autogenerated"/><span class="cnx-gentext-abstract cnx-gentext-t"/></span></div><p/></div></div></div><div class="toc"><ul><li class="toc-section learning-objectives"><a href="#m59955-fs-id1168047195656" class="target-section"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t">Learning Objectives</span></a></li><li class="toc-section"><a href="#m59955-fs-id1168047627270" class="target-section"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t">The Protogalactic Cloud and the Monolithic Collapse Model</span></a></li><li class="toc-section"><a href="#m59955-fs-id1168047787003" class="target-section"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t">Collision Victims and the Multiple Merger Model</span></a></li></ul></div><div class="section learning-objectives" id="m59955-fs-id1168047195656"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 id="m59955-fs-id1168047195656"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated"/><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t">Learning Objectives</span></h3></div></div></div><p id="m59955-fs-id1168583218632"><span id="m59955-fs-id1168583218632"> </span>By the end of this section, you will be able to:</p><div class="itemizedlist" id="m59955-fs-id1168047161510"><span id="m59955-fs-id1168047161510"> </span><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p>Describe the roles played by the collapse of a single cloud and mergers with other galaxies in building the Milky Way Galaxy we see today</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Provide examples of globular clusters and satellite galaxies affected by the Milky Way&#8217;s strong gravity.</p></li></ul></div></div><p id="m59955-fs-id1168047606197"><span id="m59955-fs-id1168047606197"> </span>Information about stellar populations holds vital clues to how our Galaxy was built up over time.

To date, astronomers have now identified streams originating from 12 small galaxies that ventured too close to the much larger Milky Way. Six more streams are associated with globular clusters. It has been suggested that large globular clusters, like Omega Centauri, are actually dense nuclei of cannibalized dwarf galaxies. The globular cluster M54 is now thought to be the nucleus of the Sagittarius dwarf we discussed earlier, which is currently merging with the Milky Way (<a class="xref target-figure" href="ch25.html#m59955-OSC_Astro_25_06_M54" title="Figure&#160;25.24.&#160;Globular Cluster M54.">Figure&#160;25.24</a>).

Population I stars contain more heavy elements than globular cluster and halo stars, are typically younger and found in the disk, and are especially concentrated in the spiral arms. The Sun is a member of population I. Population I stars formed after previous generations of stars had produced heavy elements and ejected them into the interstellar medium.

Models suggest that the stars in the halo and globular clusters formed first, while the Galaxy was spherical. The gas, somewhat enriched in heavy elements by the first generation of stars, then collapsed from a spherical distribution to a rotating disk-shaped distribution. Stars are still forming today from the gas and dust that remain in the disk. Star formation occurs most rapidly in the spiral arms, where the density of interstellar matter is highest. The Galaxy captured (and still is capturing) additional stars and globular clusters from small galaxies that ventured too close to the Milky Way. In 3 to 4 billion years, the Galaxy will begin to collide with the Andromeda galaxy, and after about 7 billion years, the two galaxies will merge to form a giant elliptical galaxy.</p></div></div></div><!--CNX: Start Area: "For Further Exploration"--><div class="cnx-eoc further-exploration"><div class="title"><span>For Further Exploration</span></div><div class="section empty"><div class="title"><a href="#m59947"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated"/><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-n">25.</span><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated">.&#160;</span><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t">Thinking Ahead</span></a></div><div class="body"/></div><div class="section empty"><div class="title"><a href="#m59948"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated"/><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-n">25.1</span><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated">.&#160;</span><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t">The Architecture of the Galaxy</span></a></div><div class="body"/></div><div class="section empty"><div class="title"><a href="#m59954"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated"/><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-n">25.2</span><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated">.&#160;</span><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t">Spiral Structure</span></a></div><div class="body"/></div><div class="section empty"><div class="title"><a href="#m59950"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated"/><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-n">25.3</span><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated">.&#160;</span><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t">The Mass of the Galaxy</span></a></div><div class="body"/></div><div class="section empty"><div class="title"><a href="#m59951"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated"/><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-n">25.4</span><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated">.&#160;</span><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t">The Center of the Galaxy</span></a></div><div class="body"/></div><div class="section empty"><div class="title"><a href="#m59952"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated"/><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-n">25.5</span><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated">.&#160;</span><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t">Stellar Populations in the Galaxy</span></a></div><div class="body"/></div><div class="section"><div class="title"><a href="#m59955"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated"/><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-n">25.6</span><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated">.&#160;</span><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t">The Formation of the Galaxy</span></a></div><div class="body"><div class="section" id="m59955-fs-id1168047906700"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 id="m59955-fs-id1168047906700"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated"/><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t">Articles</span></h4></div></div></div><p id="m59955-fs-id1168047195164"><span id="m59955-fs-id1168047195164"> </span>Blitz, L. &#8220;The Dark Side of the Milky Way.&#8221; <span class="emphasis"><em>Scientific American</em></span> (October 2011): 36&#8211;43.

Construct a rotation curve for the solar system by using the orbital velocities of the planets, which can be found in <a class="link target-chapter" href="apf.html" title="Appendix&#160;F.&#160;Physical and Orbital Data for the Planets">Appendix F</a>. How does this curve differ from the rotation curve for the Galaxy? What does it tell you about where most of the mass in the solar system is concentrated?</p>

Assume that all of the mass is spread uniformly throughout a sphere with a radius of 20 light-hours. What is the density in kg/km<sup>3</sup>? (Remember that the volume of a sphere is given by <span class="inlinemediaobject"><img src="m59955/_autogen-svg2png-0002.png" style="width:; height:; vertical-align:-7.955pt;"/></span>.)
