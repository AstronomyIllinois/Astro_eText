The Galileo mission added greatly to our knowledge of the moons of Jupiter, and the Cassini mission has done the same for the Saturn system. In 2015, the NASA New Horizons spacecraft completed the initial exploration of the &#8220;classical&#8221; planets in the solar system with its flyby of Pluto and its moons. We include Pluto here because in some ways it resembles some of the larger moons in the outer solar system.

The more craters, the longer the surface has been exposed to battering from space, and the older it must therefore be. About one-quarter of Ganymede&#8217;s surface seems to be as old and heavily cratered as that of Callisto; the rest formed more recently, as we can tell by the sparse covering of impact craters as well as the relative freshness of those craters. If we judge from crater counts, this fresher terrain on Ganymede is somewhat younger than the lunar maria or the martian volcanic plains, perhaps 2 to 3 billion years old.</p><p id="m59862-fs-id1163974329654"><span id="m59862-fs-id1163974329654"> </span>The differences between Ganymede and Callisto are more than skin deep. Ganymede is a differentiated world, like the terrestrial planets. Measurements of its gravity field tell us that the rock sank to form a core about the size of our Moon, with a mantle and crust of ice &#8220;floating&#8221; above it. In addition, the Galileo spacecraft discovered that Ganymede has a magnetic field, the sure signature of a partially molten interior. There is very likely liquid water trapped within the interior. Thus, Ganymede is not a dead world but rather a place of intermittent geological activity powered by an internal heat source. Some surface features could be as young as the surface of Venus (a few hundred million years).</p><p id="m59862-fs-id1163975494025"><span id="m59862-fs-id1163975494025"> </span>The younger terrain was formed by tectonic and volcanic forces (<a class="xref target-figure" href="ch12.html#m59862-OSC_Astro_12_02_Ganymede" title="Figure&#160;12.4.&#160;Ganymede.">Figure&#160;12.4</a>). In some places, the crust apparently cracked, flooding many of the craters with water from the interior. Extensive mountain ranges were formed from compression of the crust, forming long ridges with parallel valleys spaced a few kilometers apart. In some areas, older impact craters were split and pulled apart.

This infrared radiation would have heated the disk of material near the planet that would eventually coalesce into the closer moons. Thus, any ice near Jupiter was vaporized, leaving Europa and Io with compositions similar to planets in the inner solar system.</p><p id="m59862-fs-id1163975461981"><span id="m59862-fs-id1163975461981"> </span>Despite its mainly rocky composition, Europa has an ice-covered surface, as astronomers have long known from examining spectra of sunlight reflected from it. In this it resembles Earth, which has a layer of water on its surface, but in Europa&#8217;s case the water is capped by a thick crust of ice.

Hydrocarbons are fundamental for the formation of the large carbon molecules that are essential to life on our planet. However, the temperature on Titan is far too low for liquid water or for many of the chemical processes that are essential to life as we know it. There remains, though, an intriguing possibility that Titan might have developed a different form of low-temperature carbon-based life that could operate with liquid hydrocarbons playing the role of water. The discovery of such &#8220;life as we don&#8217;t know it&#8221; could be even more exciting than finding life like ours on Mars.

How to find Pluto among them? The technique involved taking two photographs about a week apart. During that week, a planet would move a tiny bit, while the stars remained in the same place relative to each other. A new instrument called a &#8220;blink comparator&#8221; could quickly alternate the two images in an eyepiece. The stars, being in the same position on the two plates, would not appear to change as the two images were &#8220;blinked.&#8221; But a moving object would appear to wiggle back and forth as the plates were alternated.</p><p id="m59864-fs-id1163975431323"><span id="m59864-fs-id1163975431323"> </span>After examining more than 2 million stars (and many false alarms), Tombaugh found his planet on February 18, 1930.

The maximum surface temperature ranges from about 50 K when Pluto is farthest from the Sun to 60 K when it is closest. Even this small difference is enough to cause a partial sublimation (going from solid to gas) of the methane and nitrogen ice. This generates an atmosphere when Pluto is close to the Sun, and it freezes out when Pluto is farther away. Observations of distant stars seen through this thin atmosphere indicate that the surface pressure is about a ten-thousandth of Earth&#8217;s. Because Pluto is a few degrees warmer than Triton, its atmospheric pressure is about ten times greater.

Yet like Galileo and Cassini, a Pluto mission would require a nuclear electric system that used the heat from plutonium to generate the energy to power the instruments and keep them operating far from the warmth of the Sun. NASA made available one of the last of its nuclear generators for such a mission. Assuming an affordable but highly capable spacecraft could be built, there was still the problem of getting to Pluto, nearly 5 billion kilometers from Earth, without waiting decades. The answer was to use Jupiter&#8217;s gravity to slingshot the spacecraft toward Pluto.</p><p id="m59864-fs-id1163975473262"><span id="m59864-fs-id1163975473262"> </span>The 2006 launch of <em class="glossterm no-emphasis" id="m59864-autoid-cnx2dbk-idm140481033310336"><span id="m59864-autoid-cnx2dbk-idm140481033310336"> </span>New Horizons</em><a id="idm45983367419904" class="indexterm"/> started the mission with a high speed, and the Jupiter flyby just a year later gave it the required additional boost.

The Uranus and Neptune ring systems, on the other hand, are nearly the reverse of Saturn&#8217;s: they consist of dark particles confined to a few narrow rings with broad empty gaps in between. Jupiter&#8217;s ring and at least one of Saturn&#8217;s are merely transient dust bands, constantly renewed by dust grains eroded from small moons. In this section, we focus on the two most massive ring systems, those of Saturn and Uranus.</p><div class="section" id="m62178-fs-id1163976555691"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 id="m62178-fs-id1163976555691"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated"/><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t">What Causes Rings?</span></h3></div></div></div><p id="m62178-fs-id1163973264772"><span id="m62178-fs-id1163973264772"> </span>A ring is a collection of vast numbers of particles, each like a tiny moon obeying Kepler&#8217;s laws as it follows its own orbit around the planet. Thus, the inner particles revolve faster than those farther out, and the ring as a whole does not rotate as a solid body. In fact, it is better not to think of a ring rotating at all, but rather to consider the revolution (or motion in orbit) of its individual moonlets.</p><p id="m62178-fs-id1163976785918"><span id="m62178-fs-id1163976785918"> </span>If the ring particles were widely spaced, they would move independently, like separate moonlets. However, in the main rings of Saturn and Uranus the particles are close enough to exert mutual gravitational influence, and occasionally even to rub together or bounce off each other in low-speed collisions. Because of these interactions, we see phenomena such as waves that move across the rings&#8212;just the way water waves move over the surface of the ocean.</p><p id="m62178-fs-id1163976917357"><span id="m62178-fs-id1163976917357"> </span>There are two basic ideas of how such rings come to be. First is the <span class="emphasis"><em>breakup hypothesis</em></span>, which suggests that the rings are the remains of a shattered moon. A passing comet or asteroid might have collided with the moon, breaking it into pieces. Tidal forces then pulled the fragments apart, and they dispersed into a disk. The second hypothesis, which takes the reverse perspective, suggests that the rings are made of particles that were unable to come together to form a moon in the first place.</p><p id="m62178-fs-id1163976663191"><span id="m62178-fs-id1163976663191"> </span>In either theory, the gravity of the planet plays an important role. Close to the planet (see <a class="xref target-figure" href="ch12.html#m62178-OSC_Astro_12_04_FourRings" title="Figure&#160;12.25.&#160;Four Ring Systems.">Figure&#160;12.25</a>), tidal forces can tear bodies apart or inhibit loose particles from coming together. We do not know which explanation holds for any given ring, although many scientists have concluded that at least a few of the rings are relatively young and must therefore be the result of breakup.</p><div id="m62178-OSC_Astro_12_04_FourRings" class="figure"><div class="body"><div class="mediaobject" id="m62178-fs-id1163976752585"><span id="m62178-fs-id1163976752585"> </span><img src="m62178/OSC_Astro_12_04_FourRings.jpg" alt="A graph showing the locations of the ring systems of the four giant planets.

In the case of Saturn&#8217;s F Ring, close-up images revealed that it is bounded by the orbits of two moons, called Pandora and Prometheus (<a class="xref target-figure" href="ch12.html#m62178-OSC_Astro_12_04_FRing" title="Figure&#160;12.32.&#160;Saturn&#8217;s F Ring and Its Shepherd Moons.">Figure&#160;12.32</a>). These two small moons (each about 100 kilometers in diameter) are referred to as <span class="emphasis"><em>shepherd moons</em></span>, since their gravitation serves to &#8220;shepherd&#8221; the ring particles and keep them confined to a narrow ribbon.

The calculated diameter for such shepherds (about 10 kilometers) was just at the limit of detectability for the Voyager cameras, so it is impossible to say whether they are present or not. (Given all the narrow rings we see, some scientists still hope to find another more satisfactory mechanism for keeping them confined.)</p><p id="m62178-fs-id1163976873279"><span id="m62178-fs-id1163976873279"> </span>One of the outstanding problems with understanding the rings is determining their ages. Have the giant planets always had the ring systems we see today, or might these be a recent or transient addition to the solar system? In the case of the main rings of Saturn, their mass is about the same as that of the inner moon Mimas. Thus, they could have been formed by the break-up of a Mimas-sized moon, perhaps very early in solar system history, when there were many interplanetary projectiles left over from planet formation. It is harder to understand how such a catastrophic event could have taken place recently, when the solar system had become a more stable place.</p></div></div><div class="glossary" id="idm45983366771024"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><span class="cnx-gentext-glossary cnx-gentext-autogenerated"/><span class="cnx-gentext-glossary cnx-gentext-t">Glossary</span></h2></div></div></div><dl><dt><span class="glossterm" id="m62178-autoid-cnx2dbk-idm140480992609040"><span id="m62178-autoid-cnx2dbk-idm140480992609040"> </span>resonance</span><a id="idm45983366769920" class="indexterm"/></dt><dd class="glossdef"><p>an orbital condition in which one object is subject to periodic gravitational perturbations by another, most commonly arising when two objects orbiting a third have periods of revolution that are simple multiples or fractions of each other</p></dd><dt><span class="glossterm" id="m59862-autoid-cnx2dbk-idm140481038406064"><span id="m59862-autoid-cnx2dbk-idm140481038406064"> </span>tidal heating</span><a id="idm45983366767600" class="indexterm"/></dt><dd class="glossdef"><p>the heating of a planet or moon&#8217;s interior by variable tidal forces caused by changing gravitational pull from a nearby planet or moon</p></dd></dl></div><!--CNX: Start Area: "Summary"--><div class="cnx-eoc summary"><div class="title"><span>Summary</span></div><div class="section empty"><div class="title"><a href="#m59860"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated"/><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-n">12.</span><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated">.&#160;</span><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t">Thinking Ahead</span></a></div><div class="body"/></div><div class="section"><div class="title"><a href="#m59861"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated"/><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-n">12.1</span><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated">.&#160;</span><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t">Ring and Moon Systems Introduced</span></a></div><div class="body"><p id="m59861-fs-id1163975619618"><span id="m59861-fs-id1163975619618"> </span>The four jovian planets are accompanied by impressive systems of moons and rings.

Io and Europa are denser and smaller, each about the size of our Moon. Io is the most volcanically active object in the solar system.

Saturn&#8217;s rings are broad, flat, and nearly continuous, except for a handful of gaps. The particles are mostly water ice, with typical dimensions of a few centimeters. One Saturn moon, Enceladus, is today erupting geysers of water to maintain the tenuous E Ring, which is composed of very small ice crystals. The rings of Uranus are narrow ribbons separated by wide gaps and contain much less mass. Neptune&#8217;s rings are similar but contain even less material. Much of the complex structure of the rings is due to waves and resonances induced by moons within the rings or orbiting outside them. The origin and age of each of these ring systems is still a mystery.</p></div></div></div><!--CNX: Start Area: "For Further Exploration"--><div class="cnx-eoc further-exploration"><div class="title"><span>For Further Exploration</span></div><div class="section empty"><div class="title"><a href="#m59860"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated"/><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-n">12.</span><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated">.&#160;</span><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t">Thinking Ahead</span></a></div><div class="body"/></div><div class="section empty"><div class="title"><a href="#m59861"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated"/><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-n">12.1</span><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated">.&#160;</span><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t">Ring and Moon Systems Introduced</span></a></div><div class="body"/></div><div class="section empty"><div class="title"><a href="#m59862"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated"/><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-n">12.2</span><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated">.&#160;</span><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t">The Galilean Moons of Jupiter</span></a></div><div class="body"/></div><div class="section empty"><div class="title"><a href="#m59863"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated"/><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-n">12.3</span><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated">.&#160;</span><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t">Titan and Triton</span></a></div><div class="body"/></div><div class="section empty"><div class="title"><a href="#m59864"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated"/><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-n">12.4</span><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated">.&#160;</span><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t">Pluto and Charon</span></a></div><div class="body"/></div><div class="section"><div class="title"><a href="#m62178"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated"/><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-n">12.5</span><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated">.&#160;</span><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t">Planetary Rings</span></a></div><div class="body"><div class="section" id="m62178-fs-id1163973257123"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 id="m62178-fs-id1163973257123"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated"/><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t">Articles</span></h4></div></div></div><div class="section" id="m62178-fs-id1163976747230"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h5 id="m62178-fs-id1163976747230"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated"/><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t"><span class="emphasis"><em>Moons</em></span></span></h5></div></div></div><p id="m62178-fs-id1163976493424"><span id="m62178-fs-id1163976493424"> </span>Carroll, M. &#8220;Titan: What We&#8217;ve Learned about a Strange New World.&#8221; <span class="emphasis"><em>Astronomy</em></span> (March 2010): 30.
