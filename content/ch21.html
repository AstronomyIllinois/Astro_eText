Molecular clouds have a complex filamentary structure, similar to cirrus clouds in Earth&#8217;s atmosphere, but much less dense. The molecular cloud filaments can be up to 1000 light-years long. Within the clouds are cold, dense regions with typical masses of 50 to 500 times the mass of the Sun; we give these regions the highly technical name <span class="emphasis"><em>clumps</em></span>. Within these clumps, there are even denser, smaller regions called cores. The cores are the embryos of stars. The conditions in these cores&#8212;low temperature and high density&#8212;are just what is required to make stars. Remember that the essence of the life story of any star is the ongoing competition between two forces: <span class="emphasis"><em>gravity</em></span> and <span class="emphasis"><em>pressure</em></span>. The force of gravity, pulling inward, tries to make a star collapse. Internal pressure produced by the motions of the gas atoms, pushing outward, tries to force the star to expand. When a star is first forming, low temperature (and hence, low pressure) and high density (hence, greater gravitational attraction) both work to give gravity the advantage. In order to form a star&#8212;that is, a dense, hot ball of matter capable of starting nuclear reactions deep within&#8212;we need a typical core of interstellar atoms and molecules to shrink in radius and increase in density by a factor of nearly 10<sup>20</sup>.

First, the dust-shrouded interiors of molecular clouds where stellar births take place cannot be observed with visible light. Second, the timescale for the initial collapse&#8212;thousands of years&#8212;is very short, astronomically speaking. Since each star spends such a tiny fraction of its life in this stage, relatively few stars are going through the collapse process at any given time.

We will return to these questions later in this chapter.</p><p id="m59923-fs-id1163974234182"><span id="m59923-fs-id1163974234182"> </span>To keep things simple, we have described the formation of single stars. Many stars, however, are members of binary or triple systems, where several stars are born together. In this case, the stars form in nearly the same way. Widely separated binaries may each have their own disk; close binaries may share a single disk.</p></div></div><div xml:lang="en" class="section module" id="m59918"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 id="m59918"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated"/><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-n">21.2</span><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated">.&#160;</span><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t">The H&#8211;R Diagram and the Study of Stellar Evolution<sup><a href="co03.html#book-attribution-m59918">*</a></sup></span></h2></div><div class="abstract"><div class="title"><span><span class="cnx-gentext-abstract cnx-gentext-autogenerated"/><span class="cnx-gentext-abstract cnx-gentext-t"/></span></div><p/></div></div></div><div class="toc"><ul><li class="toc-section learning-objectives"><a href="#m59918-fs-id1163974298672" class="target-section"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t">Learning Objectives</span></a></li><li class="toc-section"><a href="#m59918-fs-id1163975620488" class="target-section"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t">Evolutionary Tracks</span></a></li><li class="toc-section"><a href="#m59918-fs-id1163975626280" class="target-section"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t">Evolutionary Timescales</span></a></li></ul></div><div class="section learning-objectives" id="m59918-fs-id1163974298672"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 id="m59918-fs-id1163974298672"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated"/><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t">Learning Objectives</span></h3></div></div></div><p id="m59918-fs-id1168580701692"><span id="m59918-fs-id1168580701692"> </span>By the end of this section, you will be able to:</p><div class="itemizedlist" id="m59918-fs-id1163974407546"><span id="m59918-fs-id1163974407546"> </span><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p>Determine the age of a protostar using an <em class="glossterm no-emphasis" id="m59918-autoid-cnx2dbk-idm140481026757328"><span id="m59918-autoid-cnx2dbk-idm140481026757328"> </span>H&#8211;R diagram</em><a id="idm45983356897408" class="indexterm"/> and the protostar&#8217;s luminosity and temperature</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Explain the interplay between gravity and pressure, and how the contracting protostar changes its position in the H&#8211;R diagram as a result</p></li></ul></div></div><p id="m59918-fs-id1163975548550"><span id="m59918-fs-id1163975548550"> </span>One of the best ways to summarize all of these details about how a star or protostar changes with time is to use a Hertzsprung-Russell (H&#8211;R) diagram.

After nuclear fusion begins in the star&#8217;s core (see <a class="link target-chapter" href="ch22.html#m59924" title="22..&#160;Thinking Ahead">Stars from Adolescence to Old Age</a>), main-sequence stars change because they are using up their nuclear fuel.</p><p id="m59918-fs-id1163975673872"><span id="m59918-fs-id1163975673872"> </span>Given a model that represents a star at one stage of its evolution, we can calculate what it will be like at a slightly later time.

Six curves are shown to illustrate how stars of different masses change as they evolve toward the zero-age main sequence. On each curve are dots indicating the amount of time since the initial collapse that it takes for the star to reach that position on the H-R diagram. For example, after 100 years a 100 Solar mass star will have collapsed to the point that its temperature is about 4000 K, and its luminosity is nearly 106 that of the Sun. At 1000 years the temperature is now about 20,000 K and nearly the same luminosity. At 10,000 years the star has reached the zero-age main sequence with a surface temperature of nearly 50,000 K and luminosity 106 times Solar. As a further example, a star of one Solar mass takes longer to collapse. At 100,000 years its temperature is just above 4000 K and its luminosity as about 3 times Solar.

It is transparent to infrared radiation, and the heat generated by gravitational contraction can be radiated away freely into space. Because heat builds up slowly inside the protostar, the gas pressure remains low, and the outer layers fall almost unhindered toward the center.

As the planet grows in mass, the process clears out a dust-free region in its immediate neighborhood. Calculations also show that any small dust particles and gas that were initially located in the region between the protostar and the planet, and that are not swept up by the planet, will then fall onto the star very quickly in about 50,000 years.</p><p id="m59920-fs-id1163975741266"><span id="m59920-fs-id1163975741266"> </span>Matter lying outside the planet&#8217;s orbit, in contrast, is prevented from moving into the hole by the gravitational forces exerted by the planet.

If the formation of a planet is indeed what produces and sustains holes in the disks that surround very young stars, then planets must form in 3 to 30 million years. This is a short period compared with the lifetimes of most stars and shows that the formation of planets may be a quick byproduct of the birth of stars.</p><p id="m59920-fs-id1163974229728"><span id="m59920-fs-id1163974229728"> </span>Calculations show that <span class="emphasis"><em>accretion</em></span> can drive the rapid growth of planets&#8212;small, dust-grain-size particles orbiting in the disk collide and stick together, with the larger collections growing more rapidly as they attract and capture smaller ones. Once these clumps grow to about 10 centimeters in size or so, they enter a perilous stage in their development. At that size, unless they can grow to larger than about 100 meters in diameter, they are subject to drag forces produced by friction with the gas in the disk&#8212;and their orbits can rapidly decay, plunging them into the host star. Therefore, these bodies must rapidly grow to nearly 1 kilometer in size in diameter to avoid a fiery fate. At this stage, they are considered planetesimals (the small chunks of solid matter&#8212;ice and dust particles&#8212;that you learned about in <a class="link target-chapter" href="ch07.html#m59814" title="7..&#160;Thinking Ahead">Other Worlds: An Introduction to the Solar System</a>).

As the planet-size bodies grow, they stir up the orbits of smaller objects in the area.

If the same object can be studied by both the Doppler and transit techniques, we can measure both the mass and the size of the exoplanet. This is a powerful combination that can be used to derive the average density (mass/volume) of the planet. In 1999, using measurements from ground-based telescopes, the first transiting planet was detected orbiting the star HD 209458. The planet transits its parent star for about 3 hours every 3.5 days as we view it from Earth. Doppler measurements showed that the planet around HD 209458 has about 70% the mass of Jupiter, but its radius is about 35% larger than Jupiter&#8217;s.

CoRoT discovered 32 transiting exoplanets, including the first transiting planet with a size and density similar to Earth. In 2012, the spacecraft suffered an onboard computer failure, ending the mission. Meanwhile, NASA built a much more powerful transit observatory called Kepler.</p><p id="m59921-fs-id1163975465813"><span id="m59921-fs-id1163975465813"> </span>In 2009, NASA launched the Kepler space telescope, dedicated to the discovery of transiting exoplanets.

Kepler&#8217;s cameras and ability to measure small changes in brightness very precisely enabled the discovery of thousands of exoplanets, including many multi-planet systems. The spacecraft required three reaction wheels&#8212;a type of wheel used to help control slight rotation of the spacecraft&#8212;to stabilize the pointing of the telescope and monitor the brightness of the same group of stars over and over again. Kepler was launched with four reaction wheels (one a spare), but by May 2013, two wheels had failed and the telescope could no longer be accurately pointed toward the target area. Kepler had been designed to operate for 4 years, and ironically, the pointing failure occurred exactly 4 years and 1 day after it began observing.</p><div id="m59921-OSC_Astro_21_04_KepField" class="figure"><div class="body"><div class="mediaobject" id="m59921-fs-id1163975560570"><span id="m59921-fs-id1163975560570"> </span><img src="m59921/OSC_Astro_21_04_KepField.jpg" alt="Image of Kepler&#8217;s Field of View.

A single transit shows up as a very slight drop in the brightness of the star, lasting several hours. However, astronomers must be on guard against other factors that might produce a false transit, especially when working at the limit of precision of the telescope. We must wait for a second transit of similar depth. But when another transit is observed, we don&#8217;t initially know whether it might be due to another planet in a different orbit. The &#8220;discovery&#8221; occurs only when a third transit is found with similar depth and the same spacing in time as the first pair.</p><p id="m59921-fs-id1163974220846"><span id="m59921-fs-id1163974220846"> </span>Computers normally conduct the analysis, which involves searching for tiny, periodic dips in the light from each star, extending over 4 years of observation. But the Kepler mission also has a program in which non-astronomers&#8212;citizen scientists&#8212;can examine the data. These dedicated volunteers have found several transits that were missed by the computer analyses, showing that the human eye and brain sometimes recognize unusual events that a computer was not programmed to look for.</p><p id="m59921-fs-id1163975409318"><span id="m59921-fs-id1163975409318"> </span>Measuring three or four evenly spaced transits is normally enough to &#8220;discover&#8221; an exoplanet. But in a new field like exoplanet research, we would like to find further independent verification. The strongest confirmation happens when ground-based telescopes are also able to detect a Doppler shift with the same period as the transits. However, this is generally not possible for Earth-size planets. One of the most convincing ways to verify that a dip in brightness is due to a planet is to find more planets orbiting the same star&#8212;a <span class="emphasis"><em>planetary system</em></span>. Multi-planet systems also provide alternative ways to estimate the masses of the planets, as we will discuss in the next section.</p><p id="m59921-fs-id1163975454229"><span id="m59921-fs-id1163975454229"> </span>The selection effects (or biases) in the Kepler data are similar to those in Doppler observations. Large planets are easier to find than small ones, and short-period planets are easier than long-period planets. If we require three transits to establish the presence of a planet, we are of course limited to discovering planets with orbital periods less than one-third of the observing interval. Thus, it was only in its fourth and final year of operation that Kepler was able to find planets with orbits like Earth&#8217;s that require 1 year to go around their star.</p></div><div class="section" id="m59921-fs-id1163975571648"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 id="m59921-fs-id1163975571648"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated"/><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t">Direct Detection</span></h3></div></div></div><p id="m59921-fs-id1163975635316"><span id="m59921-fs-id1163975635316"> </span>The best possible evidence for an earthlike planet elsewhere would be an image.

Suppose, for example, you were a great distance away and wished to detect reflected light from Earth. Earth intercepts and reflects less than one billionth of the Sun&#8217;s radiation, so its apparent brightness in visible light is less than one billionth that of the Sun. Compounding the challenge of detecting such a faint speck of light, the planet is swamped by the blaze of radiation from its parent star.</p><p id="m59921-fs-id1163975841224"><span id="m59921-fs-id1163975841224"> </span>Even today, the best telescope mirrors&#8217; optics have slight imperfections that prevent the star&#8217;s light from coming into focus in a completely sharp point.</p><p id="m59921-fs-id1163975330034"><span id="m59921-fs-id1163975330034"> </span>Direct imaging works best for young gas giant planets that emit infrared light and reside at large separations from their host stars.

The brightness of the planet can be measured at different wavelengths. These observations provide an estimate for the temperature of the planet&#8217;s atmosphere; in the case of HR 8799 planet 1, the color suggests the presence of thick clouds. Spectra can also be obtained from the faint light to analyze the atmospheric constituents. A spectrum of HR 8799 planet 1 indicates a hydrogen-rich atmosphere, while the closer planet 4 shows evidence for methane in the atmosphere.</p><p id="m59921-fs-id1163975450522"><span id="m59921-fs-id1163975450522"> </span>Another way to overcome the blurring effect of Earth&#8217;s atmosphere is to observe from space. Infrared may be the optimal wavelength range in which to observe because planets get brighter in the infrared while stars like our Sun get fainter, thereby making it easier to detect a planet against the glare of its star. Special optical techniques can be used to suppress the light from the central star and make it easier to see the planet itself. However, even if we go into space, it will be difficult to obtain images of Earth-size planets.</p></div></div><div xml:lang="en" class="section module" id="m62183"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 id="m62183"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated"/><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-n">21.5</span><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated">.&#160;</span><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t">Exoplanets Everywhere: What We Are Learning<sup><a href="co03.html#book-attribution-m62183">*</a></sup></span></h2></div><div class="abstract"><div class="title"><span><span class="cnx-gentext-abstract cnx-gentext-autogenerated"/><span class="cnx-gentext-abstract cnx-gentext-t"/></span></div><p/></div></div></div><div class="toc"><ul><li class="toc-section learning-objectives"><a href="#m62183-fs-id1163976532505" class="target-section"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t">Learning Objectives</span></a></li><li class="toc-section"><a href="#m62183-fs-id1163976572680" class="target-section"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t">Kepler Results</span></a></li><li class="toc-section"><a href="#m62183-fs-id1163976549584" class="target-section"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t">Planets with Known Densities</span></a></li><li class="toc-section"><a href="#m62183-fs-id1163976874660" class="target-section"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t">Exoplanetary Systems</span></a></li></ul></div><div class="section learning-objectives" id="m62183-fs-id1163976532505"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 id="m62183-fs-id1163976532505"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated"/><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t">Learning Objectives</span></h3></div></div></div><p id="m62183-fs-id1168583665275"><span id="m62183-fs-id1168583665275"> </span>By the end of this section, you will be able to:</p><div class="itemizedlist" id="m62183-fs-id1163976876325"><span id="m62183-fs-id1163976876325"> </span><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p>Explain what we have learned from our discovery of exoplanets</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Identify which kind of exoplanets appear to be the most common in the Galaxy</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Discuss the kinds of planetary systems we are finding around other stars</p></li></ul></div></div><p id="m62183-fs-id1163976803304"><span id="m62183-fs-id1163976803304"> </span>Before the discovery of exoplanets, most astronomers expected that other planetary systems would be much like our own&#8212;planets following roughly circular orbits, with the most massive planets several AU from their parent star.

Eventually, this core becomes massive enough to begin sweeping up gaseous material in the disk, thereby building the gas giants Jupiter and Saturn.</p><div class="section" id="m62187-fs-id1163976539006"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 id="m62187-fs-id1163976539006"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated"/><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t">How to Make a Hot Jupiter</span></h3></div></div></div><p id="m62187-fs-id1163976673467"><span id="m62187-fs-id1163976673467"> </span>The traditional model for the formation of planets works only if the giant planets are formed far from the central star (about 5&#8211;10 AU), where the disk is cold enough to have a fairly high density of solid matter.

As it loses momentum (through a process that reminds us of the effects of friction), the planet will spiral inward. This process can transport giant planets, initially formed in cold regions of the disk, closer to the central star&#8212;thereby producing hot Jupiters. Gravitational interactions between planets in the chaotic early solar system can also cause planets to slingshot inward from large distances. But for this to work, the other planet has to carry away the angular momentum and move to a more distant orbit.</p><p id="m62187-fs-id1163976405039"><span id="m62187-fs-id1163976405039"> </span>In some cases, we can use the combination of transit plus Doppler measurements to determine whether the planets orbit in the same plane and in the same direction as the star.

This is a tightly packed system of five planets&#8212;the smallest comparable in size to Mercury and the largest similar in size to Venus. All five planets were detected with the Kepler spacecraft as they transited their parent star. All five planets orbit their host star in less than the time it takes Mercury to complete one orbit about the Sun. Remarkably, the host star Kepler-444 is more than 11 billion years old and formed when the Milky Way was only 2 billion years old. So the heavier elements needed to make rocky planets must have already been available then. This ancient planetary system sets the clock on the beginning of rocky planet formation to be relatively soon after the formation of our Galaxy.</p><p id="m62187-fs-id1163976915754"><span id="m62187-fs-id1163976915754"> </span>Kepler data demonstrate that while rocky planets inside Mercury&#8217;s orbit are missing from our solar system, they are common around other stars, like Kepler-444. When the first systems packed with close-in rocky planets were discovered, we wondered why they were so different from our solar system. When many such systems were discovered, we began to wonder if it was our solar system that was different. This led to speculation that additional rocky planets might once have existed close to the Sun in our solar system.</p><p id="m62187-fs-id1163973214530"><span id="m62187-fs-id1163973214530"> </span>There is some evidence from the motions in the outer solar system that Jupiter may have migrated inward long ago. If correct, then gravitational perturbations from Jupiter could have dislodged the orbits of close-in rocky planets, causing them to fall into the Sun. Consistent with this picture, astronomers now think that Uranus and Neptune probably did not form at their present distances from the Sun but rather closer to where Jupiter and Saturn are now. The reason for this idea is that density in the disk of matter surrounding the Sun at the time the planets formed was so low outside the orbit of Saturn that it would take several billion years to build up Uranus and Neptune. Yet we saw earlier in the chapter that the disks around protostars survive only a few million years.</p><p id="m62187-fs-id1163976824638"><span id="m62187-fs-id1163976824638"> </span>Therefore, scientists have developed computer models demonstrating that Uranus and Neptune could have formed near the current locations of Jupiter and Saturn, and then been kicked out to larger distances through gravitational interactions with their neighbors. All these wonderful new observations illustrate how dangerous it can be to draw conclusions about a phenomenon in science (in this case, how planetary systems form and arrange themselves) when you are only working with a single example.</p><p id="m62187-fs-id1163976895198"><span id="m62187-fs-id1163976895198"> </span>Exoplanets have given rise to a new picture of planetary system formation&#8212;one that is much more chaotic than we originally thought. If we think of the planets as being like skaters in a rink, our original model (with only our own solar system as a guide) assumed that the planets behaved like polite skaters, all obeying the rules of the rink and all moving in nearly the same direction, following roughly circular paths. The new picture corresponds more to a roller derby, where the skaters crash into one another, change directions, and sometimes are thrown entirely out of the rink.</p></div><div class="section" id="m62187-fs-id1163976797749"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 id="m62187-fs-id1163976797749"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated"/><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t">Habitable Exoplanets</span></h3></div></div></div><p id="m62187-fs-id1163976895328"><span id="m62187-fs-id1163976895328"> </span>While thousands of exoplanets have been discovered in the past two decades, every observational technique has fallen short of finding more than a few candidates that resemble Earth (<a class="xref target-figure" href="ch21.html#m62187-OSC_Astro_21_06_OtrEarths" title="Figure&#160;21.27.&#160;Many Earthlike Planets.">Figure&#160;21.27</a>).

The discovery of exoplanets and the knowledge that most stars have planetary systems are transforming our thinking about life beyond Earth. We are closer than ever to knowing whether habitable (and inhabited) planets are common. This work lends a new spirit of optimism to the search for life elsewhere, a subject to which we will return in <a class="link target-chapter" href="ch30.html#m59984" title="30..&#160;Thinking Ahead">Life in the Universe</a>.</p><div id="m62187-fs-id1163976632661" class="note astronomy link-to-learning"><div class="title"><span class="cnx-gentext-tip-t"/></div><div class="body"><p id="m62187-fs-id1163973132934"><span id="m62187-fs-id1163973132934"> </span>Check out the habitability of various stars and planets by trying out the interactive <a class="link" href="https://openstaxcollege.org/l/30cirhabzonsim">Circumstellar Habitable Zone Simulator</a> and select a star system to investigate.</p></div></div></div></div><div class="glossary" id="idm45983356029184"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><span class="cnx-gentext-glossary cnx-gentext-autogenerated"/><span class="cnx-gentext-glossary cnx-gentext-t">Glossary</span></h2></div></div></div><dl><dt><span class="glossterm" id="m59921-autoid-cnx2dbk-idm140481013385008"><span id="m59921-autoid-cnx2dbk-idm140481013385008"> </span>exoplanet</span><a id="idm45983356028144" class="indexterm"/></dt><dd class="glossdef"><p>a planet orbiting a star other than our Sun</p></dd><dt><span class="glossterm" id="m59923-autoid-cnx2dbk-idm140481013941984"><span id="m59923-autoid-cnx2dbk-idm140481013941984"> </span>giant molecular clouds</span><a id="idm45983356026080" class="indexterm"/></dt><dd class="glossdef"><p>large, cold interstellar clouds with diameters of dozens of light-years and typical masses of 10<sup>5</sup> solar masses; found in the spiral arms of galaxies, these clouds are where stars form</p></dd><dt><span class="glossterm" id="m59923-autoid-cnx2dbk-idm140481013939600"><span id="m59923-autoid-cnx2dbk-idm140481013939600"> </span>Herbig-Haro (HH) object</span><a id="idm45983356023488" class="indexterm"/></dt><dd class="glossdef"><p>luminous knots of gas in an area of star formation that are set to glow by jets of material from a protostar</p></dd><dt><span class="glossterm" id="m62183-autoid-cnx2dbk-idm140481043651840"><span id="m62183-autoid-cnx2dbk-idm140481043651840"> </span>mini-Neptune</span><a id="idm45983356021360" class="indexterm"/></dt><dd class="glossdef"><p>a planet that is intermediate between the largest terrestrial planet in our solar system (Earth) and the smallest jovian planet (Neptune); generally, mini-Neptunes have sizes between 2.8 and 4 times Earth&#8217;s size</p></dd><dt><span class="glossterm" id="m59923-autoid-cnx2dbk-idm140481013926784"><span id="m59923-autoid-cnx2dbk-idm140481013926784"> </span>protostar</span><a id="idm45983356018928" class="indexterm"/></dt><dd class="glossdef"><p>a very young star still in the process of formation, before nuclear fusion begins</p></dd><dt><span class="glossterm" id="m59923-autoid-cnx2dbk-idm140481013924928"><span id="m59923-autoid-cnx2dbk-idm140481013924928"> </span>stellar wind</span><a id="idm45983356016832" class="indexterm"/></dt><dd class="glossdef"><p>the outflow of gas, sometimes at speeds as high as hundreds of kilometers per second, from a star</p></dd><dt><span class="glossterm" id="m62183-autoid-cnx2dbk-idm140481043653792"><span id="m62183-autoid-cnx2dbk-idm140481043653792"> </span>super-Earth</span><a id="idm45983356014720" class="indexterm"/></dt><dd class="glossdef"><p>a planet larger than Earth, generally between 1.4 and 2.8 times the size of our planet</p></dd><dt><span class="glossterm" id="m59921-autoid-cnx2dbk-idm140481013383152"><span id="m59921-autoid-cnx2dbk-idm140481013383152"> </span>transit</span><a id="idm45983356012624" class="indexterm"/></dt><dd class="glossdef"><p>when one astronomical object moves in front of another</p></dd></dl></div><!--CNX: Start Area: "Summary"--><div class="cnx-eoc summary"><div class="title"><span>Summary</span></div><div class="section empty"><div class="title"><a href="#m59915"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated"/><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-n">21.</span><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated">.&#160;</span><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t">Thinking Ahead</span></a></div><div class="body"/></div><div class="section"><div class="title"><a href="#m59923"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated"/><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-n">21.1</span><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated">.&#160;</span><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t">Star Formation</span></a></div><div class="body"><p id="m59923-fs-id1163975741831"><span id="m59923-fs-id1163975741831"> </span>Most stars form in giant molecular clouds with masses as large as 3 &#215; 10<sup>6</sup> solar masses. The most well-studied molecular cloud is Orion, where star formation is currently taking place. Molecular clouds typically contain regions of higher density called clumps, which in turn contain several even-denser cores of gas and dust, each of which may become a star. A star can form inside a core if its density is high enough that gravity can overwhelm the internal pressure and cause the gas and dust to collapse. The accumulation of material halts when a protostar develops a strong stellar wind, leading to jets of material being observed coming from the star. These jets of material can collide with the material around the star and produce regions that emit light that are known as Herbig-Haro objects.</p></div></div><div class="section"><div class="title"><a href="#m59918"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated"/><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-n">21.2</span><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated">.&#160;</span><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t">The H&#8211;R Diagram and the Study of Stellar Evolution</span></a></div><div class="body"><p id="m59918-fs-id1163975780397"><span id="m59918-fs-id1163975780397"> </span>The evolution of a star can be described in terms of changes in its temperature and luminosity, which can best be followed by plotting them on an H&#8211;R diagram.

After a few million years, the inner part of the disk is cleared of dust, and the disk is then shaped like a donut with the protostar centered in the hole&#8212;something that can be explained by the formation of planets in that inner zone. Around a few older stars, we see disks formed from the debris produced when small bodies (comets and asteroids) collide with each other. The distribution of material in the rings of debris disks is probably determined by shepherd planets, just as Saturn&#8217;s shepherd moons affect the orbits of the material in its rings. Protoplanets that grow to be 10 times the mass of Earth or bigger while there is still considerable gas in their disk can then capture more of that gas and become giant planets like Jupiter in the solar system.</p></div></div><div class="section"><div class="title"><a href="#m59921"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated"/><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-n">21.4</span><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated">.&#160;</span><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t">Planets beyond the Solar System: Search and Discovery</span></a></div><div class="body"><p id="m59921-fs-id1163974189553"><span id="m59921-fs-id1163974189553"> </span>Several observational techniques have successfully detected planets orbiting other stars.

Still, we can use the Kepler discoveries to extrapolate the distribution of planets in our Galaxy. The data so far imply that planets like Earth are the most common type of planet, and that there may be 100 billion Earth-size planets around Sun-like stars in the Galaxy. About 2600 planetary systems have been discovered around other stars. In many of them, planets are arranged differently than in our solar system.</p></div></div><div class="section"><div class="title"><a href="#m62187"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated"/><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-n">21.6</span><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated">.&#160;</span><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t">New Perspectives on Planet Formation</span></a></div><div class="body"><p id="m62187-fs-id1163976933973"><span id="m62187-fs-id1163976933973"> </span>The ensemble of exoplanets is incredibly diverse and has led to a revision in our understanding of planet formation that includes the possibility of vigorous, chaotic interactions, with planet migration and scattering. It is possible that the solar system is unusual (and not representative) in how its planets are arranged. Many systems seem to have rocky planets farther inward than we do, for example, and some even have &#8220;hot Jupiters&#8221; very close to their star. Ambitious space experiments should make it possible to image earthlike planets outside the solar system and even to obtain information about their habitability as we search for life elsewhere.</p></div></div></div><!--CNX: Start Area: "For Further Exploration"--><div class="cnx-eoc further-exploration"><div class="title"><span>For Further Exploration</span></div><div class="section empty"><div class="title"><a href="#m59915"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated"/><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-n">21.</span><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated">.&#160;</span><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t">Thinking Ahead</span></a></div><div class="body"/></div><div class="section empty"><div class="title"><a href="#m59923"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated"/><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-n">21.1</span><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated">.&#160;</span><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t">Star Formation</span></a></div><div class="body"/></div><div class="section empty"><div class="title"><a href="#m59918"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated"/><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-n">21.2</span><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated">.&#160;</span><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t">The H&#8211;R Diagram and the Study of Stellar Evolution</span></a></div><div class="body"/></div><div class="section empty"><div class="title"><a href="#m59920"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated"/><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-n">21.3</span><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated">.&#160;</span><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t">Evidence That Planets Form around Other Stars</span></a></div><div class="body"/></div><div class="section empty"><div class="title"><a href="#m59921"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated"/><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-n">21.4</span><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated">.&#160;</span><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t">Planets beyond the Solar System: Search and Discovery</span></a></div><div class="body"/></div><div class="section empty"><div class="title"><a href="#m62183"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated"/><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-n">21.5</span><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated">.&#160;</span><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t">Exoplanets Everywhere: What We Are Learning</span></a></div><div class="body"/></div><div class="section"><div class="title"><a href="#m62187"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated"/><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-n">21.6</span><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated">.&#160;</span><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t">New Perspectives on Planet Formation</span></a></div><div class="body"><div class="section" id="m62187-fs-id1163973144452"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 id="m62187-fs-id1163973144452"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated"/><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t">Articles</span></h4></div></div></div><div class="section" id="m62187-fs-id1163976808146"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h5 id="m62187-fs-id1163976808146"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated"/><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t"><span class="emphasis"><em>Star Formation</em></span></span></h5></div></div></div><p id="m62187-fs-id1163976684539"><span id="m62187-fs-id1163976684539"> </span>Blaes, O. &#8220;A Universe of Disks.&#8221; <span class="emphasis"><em>Scientific American</em></span> (October 2004): 48.
