Just as he was about to finish his degree and accept an offer to work at the soon-to be completed 5-meter telescope, the United States entered World War I, and Hubble enlisted as an officer. Although the war had ended by the time he arrived in Europe, he received more officer&#8217;s training abroad and enjoyed a brief time of further astronomical study at Cambridge before being sent home.</p><p id="m59964-fs-id1168048775646"><span id="m59964-fs-id1168048775646"> </span>In 1919, at age 30, he joined the staff at Mount Wilson and began working with the world&#8217;s largest telescope. Ripened by experience, energetic, disciplined, and a skillful observer, Hubble soon established some of the most important ideas in modern astronomy. He showed that other galaxies existed, classified them on the basis of their shapes, found a pattern to their motion (and thus put the notion of an expanding universe on a firm observational footing), and began a lifelong program to study the distribution of galaxies in the universe. Although a few others had glimpsed pieces of the puzzle, it was Hubble who put it all together and showed that an understanding of the large-scale structure of the universe was feasible.</p><p id="m59964-fs-id1168048622086"><span id="m59964-fs-id1168048622086"> </span>His work brought Hubble much renown and many medals, awards, and honorary degrees. As he became better known (he was the first astronomer to appear on the cover of <span class="emphasis"><em>Time</em></span> magazine), he and his wife enjoyed and cultivated friendships with movie stars and writers in Southern California. Hubble was instrumental (if you&#8217;ll pardon the pun) in the planning and building of the 5-meter telescope on Palomar Mountain, and he had begun to use it for studying galaxies when he passed away from a stroke in 1953.</p><p id="m59964-fs-id1168048295334"><span id="m59964-fs-id1168048295334"> </span>When astronomers built a space telescope that would allow them to extend Hubble&#8217;s work to distances he could only dream about, it seemed natural to name it in his honor.

Ellipticals were those galaxies in which all the interstellar matter was converted rapidly into stars.

In the same way, many astronomers today feel we may be closing in on a far more sophisticated understanding of the large-scale structure of the universe&#8212;if only we can learn more about the nature and properties of dark matter. If you follow astronomy articles in the news (as we hope you will), you should be hearing more about dark matter in the years to come.</p></div></div><div xml:lang="en" class="section module" id="m59960"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 id="m59960"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated"/><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-n">26.4</span><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated">.&#160;</span><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t">The Extragalactic Distance Scale<sup><a href="co03.html#book-attribution-m59960">*</a></sup></span></h2></div><div class="abstract"><div class="title"><span><span class="cnx-gentext-abstract cnx-gentext-autogenerated"/><span class="cnx-gentext-abstract cnx-gentext-t"/></span></div><p/></div></div></div><div class="toc"><ul><li class="toc-section learning-objectives"><a href="#m59960-fs-id1168048498435" class="target-section"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t">Learning Objectives</span></a></li><li class="toc-section"><a href="#m59960-fs-id1168048744530" class="target-section"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t">Variable Stars</span></a></li><li class="toc-section"><a href="#m59960-fs-id1168048292494" class="target-section"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t">Standard Bulbs</span></a></li><li class="toc-section"><a href="#m59960-fs-id1168046085942" class="target-section"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t">Other Measuring Techniques</span></a></li></ul></div><div class="section learning-objectives" id="m59960-fs-id1168048498435"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 id="m59960-fs-id1168048498435"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated"/><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t">Learning Objectives</span></h3></div></div></div><p id="m59960-fs-id1168584171448"><span id="m59960-fs-id1168584171448"> </span>By the end of this section, you will be able to:</p><div class="itemizedlist" id="m59960-fs-id1168048334364"><span id="m59960-fs-id1168048334364"> </span><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p>Describe the use of <em class="glossterm no-emphasis" id="m59960-autoid-cnx2dbk-idm140480994575488"><span id="m59960-autoid-cnx2dbk-idm140480994575488"> </span>variable stars</em><a id="idm45983350776448" class="indexterm"/> to estimate distances to galaxies</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Explain how <em class="glossterm no-emphasis" id="m59960-autoid-cnx2dbk-idm140481036608784"><span id="m59960-autoid-cnx2dbk-idm140481036608784"> </span>standard bulb</em><a id="idm45983350773904" class="indexterm"/>s and the Tully-Fisher relation can be used to estimate distances to galaxies</p></li></ul></div></div><p id="m59960-fs-id1168048317328"><span id="m59960-fs-id1168048317328"> </span>To determine many of the properties of a galaxy, such as its luminosity or size, we must first know how far away it is. If we know the distance to a galaxy, we can convert how bright the galaxy appears to us in the sky into its true luminosity because we know the precise way light is dimmed by distance. (The same galaxy 10 times farther away, for example, would look 100 times dimmer.) But the measurement of galaxy distances is one of the most difficult problems in modern astronomy: all galaxies are far away, and most are so distant that we cannot even make out individual stars in them.</p><p id="m59960-fs-id1168048317881"><span id="m59960-fs-id1168048317881"> </span>For decades after Hubble&#8217;s initial work, the techniques used to measure galaxy distances were relatively inaccurate, and different astronomers derived distances that differed by as much as a factor of two. (Imagine if the distance between your home or dorm and your astronomy class were this uncertain; it would be difficult to make sure you got to class on time.) In the past few decades, however, astronomers have devised new techniques for measuring distances to galaxies; most importantly, all of them give the same answer to within an accuracy of about 10%. As we will see, this means we may finally be able to make reliable estimates of the size of the universe.</p><div class="section" id="m59960-fs-id1168048744530"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 id="m59960-fs-id1168048744530"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated"/><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t">Variable Stars</span></h3></div></div></div><p id="m59960-fs-id1168048541724"><span id="m59960-fs-id1168048541724"> </span>Before astronomers could measure distances to other galaxies, they first had to establish the scale of cosmic distances using objects in our own Galaxy.

Astronomers using large telescopes could record the spectrum of a faint star or galaxy on photographic plates, guiding their telescopes so they remained pointed to the same object for many hours and collected more light. The resulting spectra of galaxies contained a wealth of information about the composition of the galaxy and the velocities of these great star systems.</p><div class="section" id="m62195-fs-id1168047542348"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 id="m62195-fs-id1168047542348"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated"/><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t">Slipher&#8217;s Pioneering Observations</span></h3></div></div></div><p id="m62195-fs-id1168047918917"><span id="m62195-fs-id1168047918917"> </span>Curiously, the discovery of the expansion of the universe began with the search for Martians and other solar systems.

The use of Hubble&#8217;s law as a distance indicator requires only a spectrum of a galaxy and a measurement of the Doppler shift, and with large telescopes and modern spectrographs, spectra can be taken of extremely faint galaxies.</p><p id="m62195-fs-id1168047204318"><span id="m62195-fs-id1168047204318"> </span>But, as is often the case in science, things are not so simple. This technique works if, and only if, the Hubble constant has been truly constant throughout the entire life of the universe. When we observe galaxies billions of light-years away, we are seeing them as they were billions of years ago. What if the Hubble &#8220;constant&#8221; was different billions of years ago? Before 1998, astronomers thought that, although the universe is expanding, the expansion should be slowing down, or decelerating, because the overall gravitational pull of all matter in the universe would have a dominant, measureable effect. If the expansion is decelerating, then the Hubble constant should be decreasing over time.</p><p id="m62195-fs-id1168047316374"><span id="m62195-fs-id1168047316374"> </span>The discovery that <em class="glossterm no-emphasis" id="m62195-autoid-cnx2dbk-idm140481009449216"><span id="m62195-autoid-cnx2dbk-idm140481009449216"> </span>type Ia supernova</em><a id="idm45983350411904" class="indexterm"/>e are standard bulbs gave astronomers the tool they needed to observe extremely distant galaxies and measure the rate of expansion billions of years ago.

The ant at the 7-centimeters mark, which was originally 5 centimeters away from our ant, is now 10 centimeters away; it thus had to move at 5 centimeters per minute. The one that started at the 12-centimeters mark, which was 10 centimeters away from the ant doing the counting, is now 20 centimeters away, meaning it must have raced away at a speed of 10 centimeters per minute. Ants at different distances move away at different speeds, and their speeds are proportional to their distances (just as Hubble&#8217;s law indicates for galaxies). Yet, notice in our example that all the ruler was doing was stretching uniformly. Also, notice that none of the ants were actually moving of their own accord, it was the stretching of the ruler that moved them apart.</p><p id="m62195-fs-id1168047971039"><span id="m62195-fs-id1168047971039"> </span>Now let&#8217;s repeat the analysis, but put the intelligent ant on some other mark&#8212;say, on 7 or 12 centimeters. We discover that, as long as the ruler stretches uniformly, this ant also finds every other ant moving away at a speed proportional to its distance. In other words, the kind of relationship expressed by Hubble&#8217;s law can be explained by a uniform stretching of the &#8220;world&#8221; of the ants.

It isn&#8217;t as if the raisins decided to take a trip away from each other and then hopped on a hoverboard to get away. No, in both our analogies, it was the stretching of the medium (the ruler or the bread) that moved the ants or the raisins farther apart.

As space stretches, the galaxies are carried farther and farther apart much as the ants and the raisins were. (If this notion of the &#8220;stretching&#8221; of space surprises or bothers you, now would be a good time to review the information about spacetime in <a class="link target-chapter" href="ch24.html#m59938" title="24..&#160;Thinking Ahead">Black Holes and Curved Spacetime</a>.

The mass-to-light ratios of whole galaxies, including their outer regions, are as high as 100, indicating the presence of a great deal of dark matter.</p></div></div><div class="section"><div class="title"><a href="#m59960"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated"/><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-n">26.4</span><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated">.&#160;</span><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t">The Extragalactic Distance Scale</span></a></div><div class="body"><p id="m59960-fs-id1168048258602"><span id="m59960-fs-id1168048258602"> </span>Astronomers determine the distances to galaxies using a variety of methods, including the period-luminosity relationship for cepheid variables; objects such as type Ia supernovae, which appear to be standard bulbs; and the Tully-Fisher relation, which connects the line broadening of 21-cm radiation to the luminosity of spiral galaxies.

Observations show that the spectral lines of distant galaxies are redshifted, and that their recession velocities are proportional to their distances from us, a relationship known as Hubble&#8217;s law. The rate of recession, called the Hubble constant, is approximately 22 kilometers per second per million light-years. We are not at the center of this expansion: an observer in any other galaxy would see the same pattern of expansion that we do. The expansion described by Hubble&#8217;s law is best understood as a stretching of space.</p></div></div></div><!--CNX: Start Area: "For Further Exploration"--><div class="cnx-eoc further-exploration"><div class="title"><span>For Further Exploration</span></div><div class="section empty"><div class="title"><a href="#m59956"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated"/><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-n">26.</span><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated">.&#160;</span><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t">Thinking Ahead</span></a></div><div class="body"/></div><div class="section empty"><div class="title"><a href="#m59964"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated"/><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-n">26.1</span><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated">.&#160;</span><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t">The Discovery of Galaxies</span></a></div><div class="body"/></div><div class="section empty"><div class="title"><a href="#m59958"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated"/><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-n">26.2</span><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated">.&#160;</span><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t">Types of Galaxies</span></a></div><div class="body"/></div><div class="section empty"><div class="title"><a href="#m59959"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated"/><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-n">26.3</span><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated">.&#160;</span><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t">Properties of Galaxies</span></a></div><div class="body"/></div><div class="section empty"><div class="title"><a href="#m59960"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated"/><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-n">26.4</span><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated">.&#160;</span><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t">The Extragalactic Distance Scale</span></a></div><div class="body"/></div><div class="section"><div class="title"><a href="#m62195"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated"/><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-n">26.5</span><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated">.&#160;</span><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t">The Expanding Universe</span></a></div><div class="body"><div class="section" id="m62195-fs-id1168047342310"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 id="m62195-fs-id1168047342310"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated"/><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t">Articles</span></h4></div></div></div><p id="m62195-fs-id1168047669150"><span id="m62195-fs-id1168047669150"> </span>Andrews, B. &#8220;What Are Galaxies Trying to Tell Us?&#8221; <span class="emphasis"><em>Astronomy</em></span> (February 2011): 24.

Only a handful of astronomers (all male&#8212;since, until the 1960s, women were not given time on these two telescopes) were allowed to use these facilities, and in general the observers did not compete with each other but worked on different problems. Now there are many other telescopes, and several different groups do often work on the same problem.
