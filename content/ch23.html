(We will explain why this mass is the crucial dividing line in a moment.) Note that most stars in the universe fall into this category. The number of stars decreases as mass increases; really massive stars are rare (see <a class="link target-chapter" href="ch18.html#m59897" title="18..&#160;Thinking Ahead">The Stars: A Celestial Census</a>). This is similar to the music business where only a few musicians ever become superstars. Furthermore, many stars with an initial mass much greater than 1.4 <span class="emphasis"><em>M</em></span><sub>Sun</sub> will be reduced to that level by the time they die. For example, we now know that stars that start out with masses of at least 8.0 <span class="emphasis"><em>M</em></span><sub>Sun</sub> (and possibly as much as 10 <span class="emphasis"><em>M</em></span><sub>Sun</sub>) manage to lose enough mass during their lives to fit into this category (an accomplishment anyone who has ever attempted to lose weight would surely envy).</p><div class="section" id="m59932-fs-id1168047306225"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 id="m59932-fs-id1168047306225"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated"/><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t">A Star in Crisis</span></h3></div></div></div><p id="m59932-fs-id1168047202349"><span id="m59932-fs-id1168047202349"> </span>In the last chapter, we left the life story of a star with a mass like the Sun&#8217;s just after it had climbed up to the red-giant region of the H&#8211;R diagram for a second time and had shed some of its outer layers to form a planetary nebula. Recall that during this time, the <span class="emphasis"><em>core</em></span> of the star was undergoing an &#8220;energy crisis.&#8221; Earlier in its life, during a brief stable period, helium in the core had gotten hot enough to fuse into carbon (and oxygen). But after this helium was exhausted, the star&#8217;s core had once more found itself without a source of pressure to balance gravity and so had begun to contract.</p><p id="m59932-fs-id1168047521575"><span id="m59932-fs-id1168047521575"> </span>This collapse is the final event in the life of the core. Because the star&#8217;s mass is relatively low, it cannot push its core temperature high enough to begin another round of fusion (in the same way larger-mass stars can). The core continues to shrink until it reaches a density equal to nearly a million times the density of water! That is 200,000 times greater than the average density of Earth. At this extreme density, a new and different way for matter to behave kicks in and helps the star achieve a final state of equilibrium. In the process, what remains of the star becomes one of the strange <span class="emphasis"><em>white dwarfs</em></span> that we met in <a class="link target-chapter" href="ch18.html#m59897" title="18..&#160;Thinking Ahead">The Stars: A Celestial Census</a>.</p></div><div class="section" id="m59932-fs-id1168047793504"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 id="m59932-fs-id1168047793504"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated"/><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t">Degenerate Stars</span></h3></div></div></div><p id="m59932-fs-id1168047196267"><span id="m59932-fs-id1168047196267"> </span>Because white dwarfs are far denser than any substance on Earth, the matter inside them behaves in a very unusual way&#8212;unlike anything we know from everyday experience. At this high density, gravity is incredibly strong and tries to shrink the star still further, but all the <span class="emphasis"><em>electrons</em></span> resist being pushed closer together and set up a powerful pressure inside the core. This pressure is the result of the fundamental rules that govern the behavior of electrons (the quantum physics you were introduced to in <a class="link target-chapter" href="ch16.html#m59880" title="16..&#160;Thinking Ahead">The Sun: A Nuclear Powerhouse</a>). According to these rules (known to physicists as the <em class="glossterm no-emphasis" id="m59932-autoid-cnx2dbk-idm140481001482992"><span id="m59932-autoid-cnx2dbk-idm140481001482992"> </span>Pauli exclusion principle</em><a id="idm45983354938528" class="indexterm"/>), which have been verified in studies of atoms in the laboratory, no two electrons can be in the same place at the same time doing the same thing.

For most of a star&#8217;s life, the density of matter is also relatively low, and the electrons in the star are moving rapidly. This means that no two of them will be in the same place moving in exactly the same way at the same time. But this all changes when a star exhausts its store of nuclear energy and begins its final collapse.</p><p id="m59932-fs-id1168047697625"><span id="m59932-fs-id1168047697625"> </span>As the star&#8217;s core contracts, electrons are squeezed closer and closer together. Eventually, a star like the Sun becomes so dense that further contraction would in fact require two or more electrons to violate the rule against occupying the same place and moving in the same way. Such a dense gas is said to be degenerate (a term coined by physicists and not related to the electron&#8217;s moral character). The electrons in a <em class="glossterm" id="m59932-autoid-cnx2dbk-idm140481001479008"><span id="m59932-autoid-cnx2dbk-idm140481001479008"> </span>degenerate gas</em><a id="idm45983354932080" class="indexterm"/> resist further crowding with tremendous pressure.

(Note that the repulsive force between degenerate electrons is different from, and much stronger than, the normal electrical repulsion between charges that have the same sign.)</p><p id="m59932-fs-id1168047125017"><span id="m59932-fs-id1168047125017"> </span>The electrons in a degenerate gas do move about, as do particles in any gas, but not with a lot of freedom. A particular electron cannot change position or momentum until another electron in an adjacent stage gets out of the way. The situation is much like that in the parking lot after a big football game. Vehicles are closely packed, and a given car cannot move until the one in front of it moves, leaving an empty space to be filled.</p><p id="m59932-fs-id1168048147654"><span id="m59932-fs-id1168048147654"> </span>Of course, the dying star also has atomic nuclei in it, not just electrons, but it turns out that the nuclei must be squeezed to much higher densities before their quantum nature becomes apparent. As a result, in white dwarfs, the nuclei do not exhibit degeneracy pressure. Hence, in the white dwarf stage of stellar evolution, it is the degeneracy pressure of the electrons, and not of the nuclei, that halts the collapse of the core.</p></div><div class="section" id="m59932-fs-id1168047348218"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 id="m59932-fs-id1168047348218"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated"/><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t">White Dwarfs</span></h3></div></div></div><p id="m59932-fs-id1168047792562"><span id="m59932-fs-id1168047792562"> </span>White dwarfs, then, are stable, compact objects with electron-degenerate cores that cannot contract any further.

He wrote later that he felt very shy and lonely during this period, isolated from students, afraid to assert himself, and sometimes waiting for hours to speak with some of the famous professors he had read about in India.

Note that the number of bright spots has increased from 1 to more than 15 over this time interval. These spots occur where high-speed gas ejected by the supernova and moving at millions of miles per hour has reached the ring and blasted into it. The collision has heated the gas in the ring and caused it to glow more brightly. The fact that we see individual spots suggests that material ejected by the supernova is first hitting narrow, inward-projecting columns of gas in the clumpy ring. The hot spots are the first signs of a dramatic and violent collision between the new and old material that will continue over the next few years. By studying these bright spots, astronomers can determine the composition of the ring and hence learn about the nuclear processes that build heavy elements inside massive stars.

This interaction happened to only a single nucleus in each person and thus had absolutely no biological effect; it went completely unnoticed by everyone concerned.</p><p id="m59934-fs-id1168048320347"><span id="m59934-fs-id1168048320347"> </span>Since the neutrinos come directly from the heart of the supernova, their energies provided a measure of the temperature of the core as the star was exploding. The central temperature was about 200 billion K, a stunning figure to which no earthly analog can bring much meaning. With neutrino telescopes, we are peering into the final moment in the life stories of massive stars and observing conditions beyond all human experience. Yet we are also seeing the unmistakable hints of our own origins.</p></div></div><div xml:lang="en" class="section module" id="m59935"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 id="m59935"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated"/><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-n">23.4</span><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated">.&#160;</span><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t">Pulsars and the Discovery of Neutron Stars<sup><a href="co03.html#book-attribution-m59935">*</a></sup></span></h2></div><div class="abstract"><div class="title"><span><span class="cnx-gentext-abstract cnx-gentext-autogenerated"/><span class="cnx-gentext-abstract cnx-gentext-t"/></span></div><p/></div></div></div><div class="toc"><ul><li class="toc-section learning-objectives"><a href="#m59935-fs-id1168046108506" class="target-section"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t">Learning Objectives</span></a></li><li class="toc-section"><a href="#m59935-fs-id1168048332338" class="target-section"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t">The Discovery of Neutron Stars</span></a></li><li class="toc-section"><a href="#m59935-fs-id1168048370249" class="target-section"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t">A Spinning Lighthouse Model</span></a></li><li class="toc-section"><a href="#m59935-fs-id1168048777809" class="target-section"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t">Tests of the Model</span></a></li><li class="toc-section"><a href="#m59935-fs-id1168046135026" class="target-section"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t">The Evolution of Pulsars</span></a></li></ul></div><div class="section learning-objectives" id="m59935-fs-id1168046108506"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 id="m59935-fs-id1168046108506"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated"/><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t">Learning Objectives</span></h3></div></div></div><p id="m59935-fs-id1168581839221"><span id="m59935-fs-id1168581839221"> </span>By the end of this section, you will be able to:</p><div class="itemizedlist" id="m59935-fs-id1168048734253"><span id="m59935-fs-id1168048734253"> </span><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p>Explain the research method that led to the discovery of neutron stars, located hundreds or thousands of light-years away</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Describe the features of a neutron star that allow it to be detected as a pulsar</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>List the observational evidence that links pulsars and neutron stars to supernovae</p></li></ul></div></div><p id="m59935-fs-id1168048332281"><span id="m59935-fs-id1168048332281"> </span>After a type II supernova explosion fades away, all that is left behind is either a <em class="glossterm no-emphasis" id="m59935-autoid-cnx2dbk-idm140481007466512"><span id="m59935-autoid-cnx2dbk-idm140481007466512"> </span>neutron star</em><a id="idm45983354055712" class="indexterm"/> or something even more strange, a <em class="glossterm no-emphasis" id="m59935-autoid-cnx2dbk-idm140481041145312"><span id="m59935-autoid-cnx2dbk-idm140481041145312"> </span>black hole</em><a id="idm45983354053776" class="indexterm"/>.

They emit energy over a broad range of the electromagnetic spectrum. The radiation itself is also confined to a narrow beam, which explains why the pulsar acts like a lighthouse. As the rotation carries first one and then the other magnetic pole of the star into our view, we see a pulse of radiation each time.</p></div><div class="section" id="m59935-fs-id1168048777809"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 id="m59935-fs-id1168048777809"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated"/><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t">Tests of the Model</span></h3></div></div></div><p id="m59935-fs-id1168046058591"><span id="m59935-fs-id1168046058591"> </span>This explanation of pulsars in terms of beams of radiation from highly magnetic and rapidly spinning neutron stars is a very clever idea. But what evidence do we have that it is the correct model? First, we can measure the masses of some pulsars, and they do turn out be in the range of 1.4 to 1.8 times that of the Sun&#8212;just what theorists predict for neutron stars. The masses are found using Kepler&#8217;s law for those few pulsars that are members of binary star systems.</p><p id="m59935-fs-id1168048622542"><span id="m59935-fs-id1168048622542"> </span>But there is an even-better confirming argument, which brings us back to the <em class="glossterm no-emphasis" id="m59935-autoid-cnx2dbk-idm140481032472752"><span id="m59935-autoid-cnx2dbk-idm140481032472752"> </span>Crab Nebula</em><a id="idm45983353959136" class="indexterm"/> and its vast energy output. When the high-energy charged particles from the neutron star pulsar hit the slower-moving material from the supernova, they energize this material and cause it to &#8220;glow&#8221; at many different wavelengths&#8212;just what we observe from the Crab Nebula. The pulsar beams are a power source that &#8220;light up&#8221; the nebula long after the initial explosion of the star that made it.</p><p id="m59935-fs-id1168048489819"><span id="m59935-fs-id1168048489819"> </span>Who &#8220;pays the bills&#8221; for all the energy we see coming out of a remnant like the Crab Nebula? After all, when energy emerges from one place, it must be depleted in another. The ultimate energy source in our model is the rotation of the neutron star, which propels charged particles outward and spins its magnetic field at enormous speeds. As its rotational energy is used to excite the Crab Nebula year after year, the pulsar inside the nebula slows down. As it slows, the pulses come a little less often; more time elapses before the slower neutron star brings its beam back around.</p><p id="m59935-fs-id1168048511963"><span id="m59935-fs-id1168048511963"> </span>Several decades of careful observations have now shown that the Crab Nebula pulsar is not a perfectly regular clock as we originally thought: instead, it is gradually slowing down. Having measured how much the pulsar is slowing down, we can calculate how much rotation energy the neutron star is losing. Remember that it is very densely packed and spins amazingly quickly. Even a tiny slowing down can mean an immense loss of energy.</p><p id="m59935-fs-id1168048460230"><span id="m59935-fs-id1168048460230"> </span>To the satisfaction of astronomers, the rotational energy lost by the pulsar turns out to be the same as the amount of energy emerging from the nebula surrounding it. In other words, the slowing down of a rotating neutron star can explain precisely why the Crab Nebula is glowing with the amount of energy we observe.</p></div><div class="section" id="m59935-fs-id1168046135026"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 id="m59935-fs-id1168046135026"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated"/><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t">The Evolution of Pulsars</span></h3></div></div></div><p id="m59935-fs-id1168046014877"><span id="m59935-fs-id1168046014877"> </span>From observations of the <em class="glossterm no-emphasis" id="m59935-autoid-cnx2dbk-idm140481032466416"><span id="m59935-autoid-cnx2dbk-idm140481032466416"> </span>pulsar</em><a id="idm45983353949664" class="indexterm"/>s discovered so far, astronomers have concluded that one new pulsar is born somewhere in the Galaxy every 25 to 100 years, the same rate at which supernovae are estimated to occur. Calculations suggest that the typical lifetime of a pulsar is about 10 million years; after that, the neutron star no longer rotates fast enough to produce significant beams of particles and energy, and is no longer observable. We estimate that there are about 100 million neutron stars in our Galaxy, most of them rotating too slowly to come to our notice.</p><p id="m59935-fs-id1168046225390"><span id="m59935-fs-id1168046225390"> </span>The Crab pulsar is rather young (only about 960 years old) and has a short period, whereas other, older pulsars have already slowed to longer periods. Pulsars thousands of years old have lost too much energy to emit appreciably in the visible and X-ray wavelengths, and they are observed only as radio pulsars; their periods are a second or longer.</p><p id="m59935-fs-id1168048720126"><span id="m59935-fs-id1168048720126"> </span>There is one other reason we can see only a fraction of the pulsars in the Galaxy. Consider our lighthouse model again. On Earth, all ships approach on the same plane&#8212;the surface of the ocean&#8212;so the lighthouse can be built to sweep its beam over that surface. But in space, objects can be anywhere in three dimensions. As a given pulsar&#8217;s beam sweeps over a circle in space, there is absolutely no guarantee that this circle will include the direction of Earth. In fact, if you think about it, many more circles in space will <span class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> include Earth than will include it. Thus, we estimate that we are unable to observe a large number of neutron stars because their pulsar beams miss us entirely.</p><p id="m59935-fs-id1168046092868"><span id="m59935-fs-id1168046092868"> </span>At the same time, it turns out that only a few of the pulsars discovered so far are embedded in the visible clouds of gas that mark the remnant of a supernova. This might at first seem mysterious, since we know that supernovae give rise to neutron stars and we should expect each pulsar to have begun its life in a supernova explosion. But the lifetime of a pulsar turns out to be about 100 times longer than the length of time required for the expanding gas of a supernova remnant to disperse into interstellar space. Thus, most pulsars are found with no other trace left of the explosion that produced them.</p><p id="m59935-fs-id1168048780078"><span id="m59935-fs-id1168048780078"> </span>In addition, some pulsars are ejected by a supernova explosion that is not the same in all directions. If the supernova explosion is stronger on one side, it can kick the pulsar entirely out of the supernova remnant (some astronomers call this &#8220;getting a birth kick&#8221;). We know such kicks happen because we see a number of young supernova remnants in nearby galaxies where the pulsar is to one side of the remnant and racing away at several hundred miles per second (<a class="xref target-figure" href="ch23.html#m59935-OSC_Astro_23_04_Map" title="Figure&#160;23.17.&#160;Speeding Pulsar.">Figure&#160;23.17</a>).</p><div id="m59935-OSC_Astro_23_04_Map" class="figure"><div class="body"><div class="mediaobject" id="m59935-fs-id1168048515066"><span id="m59935-fs-id1168048515066"> </span><img src="m59935/OSC_Astro_23_04_Map.jpg" alt="Multi-wavelength Image of a Pulsar&#8217;s Trail.

And because any isolated white dwarf below the Chandrasekhar mass is stable, all proposed mechanisms invoke a binary companion to explode the white dwarf. The leading alternative mechanism scientists believe creates a type Ia supernova is the merger of two white dwarf stars in a binary system. The two white dwarfs may have unstable orbits, such that over time, they would slowly move closer together until they merge. If their combined mass is greater than the Chandrasekhar limit, the result could also be a type Ia supernova explosion.</p><div id="m59936-fs-id1168047915707" class="note astronomy link-to-learning"><div class="title"><span class="cnx-gentext-tip-t"/></div><div class="body"><p id="m59936-fs-id1168047581830"><span id="m59936-fs-id1168047581830"> </span>You can watch a <a class="link" href="https://openstaxcollege.org/l/30supernovavid">short video</a> about Supernova SN 2014J, a type Ia supernova discovered in the Messier 82 (M82) galaxy on January 21, 2014, as well as see brief animations of the two mechanisms by which such a supernova could form.</p></div></div><p id="m59936-fs-id1168047668571"><span id="m59936-fs-id1168047668571"> </span>Type Ia supernovae are of great interest to astronomers in other areas of research.

Such infalling gas will be compressed and heated to incredible temperatures. It will quickly become so hot that it will experience an explosive burst of fusion. The energies involved are so great that we would expect much of the radiation from the burst to emerge as X-rays. And indeed, high-energy observatories above Earth&#8217;s atmosphere (see <a class="link target-chapter" href="ch06.html#m59802" title="6..&#160;Thinking Ahead">Astronomical Instruments</a>) have recorded many objects that undergo just these types of X-ray <span class="emphasis"><em>bursts</em></span>.</p><p id="m59936-fs-id1168047345274"><span id="m59936-fs-id1168047345274"> </span>If the neutron star and its companion are positioned the right way, a significant amount of material can be transferred to the neutron star and can set it spinning faster (as spin energy is also transferred).

While the mystery of short-duration gamma-ray bursts is still being unraveled, the focus of studies for long-duration gamma-ray bursts has begun to change from understanding the origin of the bursts themselves (which is now fairly well-established) to using them as tools to understand the broader universe.</p><p id="m59937-fs-id1168048741422"><span id="m59937-fs-id1168048741422"> </span>The reason that long-duration gamma-ray bursts are useful has to do with their extreme luminosities, if only for a short time. In fact, long-duration gamma-ray bursts are so bright that they could easily be seen at distances that correspond to a few hundred million years after the expansion of the universe began, which is when theorists think that the first generation of stars formed. Some theories predict that the first stars are likely to be massive and complete their evolution in only a million years or so. If this turns out to be the case, then gamma-ray bursts (which signal the death of some of these stars) may provide us with the best way of probing the universe when stars and galaxies first began to form.</p><p id="m59937-fs-id1168048697820"><span id="m59937-fs-id1168048697820"> </span>So far, the most distant gamma-ray burst found (on April 29, 2009) was in a galaxy with a redshift that corresponds to a remarkable 13.2 billion light years&#8212;meaning it happened only 600 million years after the Big Bang itself. This is comparable to the earliest and most distant galaxies found by the Hubble Space Telescope. It is not quite old enough to expect that it formed from the first generation of stars, but its appearance at this distance still gives us useful information about the production of stars in the early universe. Astronomers continue to scan the skies, looking for even more distant events signaling the deaths of stars from even further back in time.</p></div></div><div class="glossary" id="idm45983353310816"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><span class="cnx-gentext-glossary cnx-gentext-autogenerated"/><span class="cnx-gentext-glossary cnx-gentext-t">Glossary</span></h2></div></div></div><dl><dt><span class="glossterm" id="m59932-autoid-cnx2dbk-idm140481002397712"><span id="m59932-autoid-cnx2dbk-idm140481002397712"> </span>Chandrasekhar limit</span><a id="idm45983353309728" class="indexterm"/></dt><dd class="glossdef"><p>the upper limit to the mass of a white dwarf (equals 1.4 times the mass of the Sun)</p></dd><dt><span class="glossterm" id="m59932-autoid-cnx2dbk-idm140481002395856"><span id="m59932-autoid-cnx2dbk-idm140481002395856"> </span>degenerate gas</span><a id="idm45983353307664" class="indexterm"/></dt><dd class="glossdef"><p>a gas that resists further compression because no two electrons can be in the same place at the same time doing the same thing (Pauli exclusion principle)</p></dd><dt><span class="glossterm" id="m59936-autoid-cnx2dbk-idm140481000249264"><span id="m59936-autoid-cnx2dbk-idm140481000249264"> </span>millisecond pulsar</span><a id="idm45983353305472" class="indexterm"/></dt><dd class="glossdef"><p>a pulsar that rotates so quickly that it can give off hundreds of pulses per second (and its period is therefore measured in milliseconds)</p></dd><dt><span class="glossterm" id="m59933-autoid-cnx2dbk-idm140481007778080"><span id="m59933-autoid-cnx2dbk-idm140481007778080"> </span>neutron star</span><a id="idm45983353303248" class="indexterm"/></dt><dd class="glossdef"><p>a compact object of extremely high density composed almost entirely of neutrons</p></dd><dt><span class="glossterm" id="m59936-autoid-cnx2dbk-idm140481000251264"><span id="m59936-autoid-cnx2dbk-idm140481000251264"> </span>nova</span><a id="idm45983353301152" class="indexterm"/></dt><dd class="glossdef"><p>the cataclysmic explosion produced in a binary system, temporarily increasing its luminosity by hundreds to thousands of times</p></dd><dt><span class="glossterm" id="m59935-autoid-cnx2dbk-idm140481003942800"><span id="m59935-autoid-cnx2dbk-idm140481003942800"> </span>pulsar</span><a id="idm45983353299008" class="indexterm"/></dt><dd class="glossdef"><p>a variable radio source of small physical size that emits very rapid radio pulses in very regular periods that range from fractions of a second to several seconds; now understood to be a rotating, magnetic neutron star that is energetic enough to produce a detectable beam of radiation and particles</p></dd><dt><span class="glossterm" id="m59933-autoid-cnx2dbk-idm140481007776224"><span id="m59933-autoid-cnx2dbk-idm140481007776224"> </span>type II supernova</span><a id="idm45983353296736" class="indexterm"/></dt><dd class="glossdef"><p>a stellar explosion produced at the endpoint of the evolution of stars whose mass exceeds roughly 10 times the mass of the Sun</p></dd></dl></div><!--CNX: Start Area: "Summary"--><div class="cnx-eoc summary"><div class="title"><span>Summary</span></div><div class="section empty"><div class="title"><a href="#m59931"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated"/><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-n">23.</span><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated">.&#160;</span><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t">Thinking Ahead</span></a></div><div class="body"/></div><div class="section"><div class="title"><a href="#m59932"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated"/><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-n">23.1</span><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated">.&#160;</span><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t">The Death of Low-Mass Stars</span></a></div><div class="body"><p id="m59932-fs-id1168047845447"><span id="m59932-fs-id1168047845447"> </span>During the course of their evolution, stars shed their outer layers and lose a significant fraction of their initial mass.
