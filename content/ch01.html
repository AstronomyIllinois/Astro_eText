Science is not merely a body of knowledge, but a <span class="emphasis"><em>method</em></span> by which we attempt to understand nature and how it behaves. This method begins with many observations over a period of time. From the trends found through observations, scientists can <span class="emphasis"><em>model</em></span> the particular phenomena we want to understand. Such models are always approximations of nature, subject to further testing.</p><p id="m59755-fs-id1167467389554"><span id="m59755-fs-id1167467389554"> </span>As a concrete astronomical example, ancient astronomers constructed a model (partly from observations and partly from philosophical beliefs) that Earth was the center of the universe and everything moved around it in circular orbits. At first, our available observations of the Sun, Moon, and planets did fit this model; however, after further observations, the model had to be updated by adding circle after circle to represent the movements of the planets around Earth at the center. As the centuries passed and improved instruments were developed for keeping track of objects in the sky, the old model (even with a huge number of circles) could no longer explain all the observed facts. As we will see in the chapter on <a class="link target-chapter" href="ch02.html#m59769" title="2..&#160;Thinking Ahead">Observing the Sky: The Birth of Astronomy</a>, a new model, with the Sun at the center, fit the experimental evidence better. After a period of philosophical struggle, it became accepted as our view of the universe.</p><p id="m59755-fs-id1167467456155"><span id="m59755-fs-id1167467456155"> </span>When they are first proposed, new models or ideas are sometimes called <span class="emphasis"><em>hypotheses</em></span>. You may think there can be no new hypotheses in a science such as astronomy&#8212;that everything important has already been learned. Nothing could be further from the truth. Throughout this textbook you will find discussions of recent, and occasionally still controversial, hypotheses in astronomy. For example, the significance that the huge chunks of rock and ice that hit Earth have for life on Earth itself is still debated. And while the evidence is strong that vast quantities of invisible &#8220;dark energy&#8221; make up the bulk of the universe, scientists have no convincing explanation for what the dark energy actually is. Resolving these issues will require difficult observations done at the forefront of our technology, and all such hypotheses need further testing before we incorporate them fully into our standard astronomical models.</p><p id="m59755-fs-id1167467660330"><span id="m59755-fs-id1167467660330"> </span>This last point is crucial: a hypothesis must be a proposed explanation that can be <span class="emphasis"><em>tested</em></span>. The most straightforward approach to such testing in science is to perform an experiment. If the experiment is conducted properly, its results either will agree with the predictions of the hypothesis or they will contradict it. If the experimental result is truly inconsistent with the hypothesis, a scientist must discard the hypothesis and try to develop an alternative. If the experimental result agrees with predictions, this does not necessarily prove that the hypothesis is absolutely correct; perhaps later experiments will contradict crucial parts of the hypothesis. But, the more experiments that agree with the hypothesis, the more likely we are to accept the hypothesis as a useful description of nature.</p><p id="m59755-fs-id1167470545488"><span id="m59755-fs-id1167470545488"> </span>One way to think about this is to consider a scientist who was born and lives on an island where only black sheep live. Day after day the scientist encounters black sheep only, so he or she hypothesizes that all sheep are black. Although every observed sheep adds confidence to the theory, the scientist only has to visit the mainland and observe one white sheep to prove the hypothesis wrong.</p><p id="m59755-fs-id1167470565337"><span id="m59755-fs-id1167470565337"> </span>When you read about experiments, you probably have a mental picture of a scientist in a laboratory conducting tests or taking careful measurements. This is certainly the case for a biologist or a chemist, but what can astronomers do when our laboratory is the universe? It&#8217;s impossible to put a group of stars into a test tube or to order another comet from a scientific supply company.</p><p id="m59755-fs-id1167470700557"><span id="m59755-fs-id1167470700557"> </span>As a result, astronomy is sometimes called an <span class="emphasis"><em>observational</em></span> science; we often make our tests by observing many samples of the kind of object we want to study and noting carefully how different samples vary. New instruments and technology can let us look at astronomical objects from new perspectives and in greater detail. Our hypotheses are then judged in the light of this new information, and they pass or fail in the same way we would evaluate the result of a laboratory experiment.</p><p id="m59755-fs-id1167470898808"><span id="m59755-fs-id1167470898808"> </span>Much of astronomy is also a <span class="emphasis"><em>historical</em></span> science&#8212;meaning that what we observe has already happened in the universe and we can do nothing to change it. In the same way, a geologist cannot alter what has happened to our planet, and a paleontologist cannot bring an ancient animal back to life. While this can make astronomy challenging, it also gives us fascinating opportunities to discover the secrets of our cosmic past.</p><p id="m59755-fs-id1167470861363"><span id="m59755-fs-id1167470861363"> </span>You might compare an astronomer to a detective trying to solve a crime that occurred before the detective arrived at the scene. There is lots of evidence, but both the detective and the scientist must sift through and organize the evidence to test various hypotheses about what actually happened. And there is another way in which the scientist is like a detective: they both must prove their case. The detective must convince the district attorney, the judge, and perhaps ultimately the jury that his hypothesis is correct. Similarly, the scientist must convince colleagues, editors of journals, and ultimately a broad cross-section of other scientists that her hypothesis is provisionally correct. In both cases, one can only ask for evidence &#8220;beyond a reasonable doubt.&#8221; And sometimes new evidence will force both the detective and the scientist to revise their last hypothesis.</p><p id="m59755-fs-id1167471083067"><span id="m59755-fs-id1167471083067"> </span>This self-correcting aspect of science sets it off from most human activities. Scientists spend a great deal of time questioning and challenging one another, which is why applications for project funding&#8212;as well as reports for publication in academic journals&#8212;go through an extensive process of <span class="emphasis"><em>peer review</em></span>, which is a careful examination by other scientists in the same field. In science (after formal education and training), everyone is encouraged to improve upon experiments and to challenge any and all hypotheses. New scientists know that one of the best ways to advance their careers is to find a weakness in our current understanding of something and to correct it with a new or modified hypothesis.</p><p id="m59755-fs-id1167470665280"><span id="m59755-fs-id1167470665280"> </span>This is one of the reasons science has made such dramatic progress. An undergraduate science major today knows more about science and math than did Sir Isaac Newton, one of the most renowned scientists who ever lived. Even in this introductory astronomy course, you will learn about objects and processes that no one a few generations ago even dreamed existed.</p></div><div xml:lang="en" class="section module" id="m59750"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 id="m59750"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated"/><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-n">1.3</span><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated">.&#160;</span><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t">The Laws of Nature<sup><a href="co03.html#book-attribution-m59750">*</a></sup></span></h2></div><div class="abstract"><div class="title"><span><span class="cnx-gentext-abstract cnx-gentext-autogenerated"/><span class="cnx-gentext-abstract cnx-gentext-t"/></span></div><p/></div></div></div><p id="m59750-fs-id1167470665280"><span id="m59750-fs-id1167470665280"> </span>Over centuries scientists have extracted various <span class="emphasis"><em>scientific laws</em></span> from countless observations, hypotheses, and experiments. These scientific laws are, in a sense, the &#8220;rules&#8221; of the game that nature plays. One remarkable discovery about nature&#8212;one that underlies everything you will read about in this text&#8212;is that the same laws apply everywhere in the universe. The rules that determine the motion of stars so far away that your eye cannot see them are the same laws that determine the arc of a baseball after a batter has hit it out of the park.</p><p id="m59750-fs-id1167470761758"><span id="m59750-fs-id1167470761758"> </span>Note that without the existence of such universal laws, we could not make much headway in astronomy. If each pocket of the universe had different rules, we would have little chance of interpreting what happened in other &#8220;neighborhoods.&#8221; But, the consistency of the laws of nature gives us enormous power to understand distant objects without traveling to them and learning the local laws. In the same way, if every region of a country had completely different laws, it would be very difficult to carry out commerce or even to understand the behavior of people in those different regions. A consistent set of laws, though, allows us to apply what we learn or practice in one state to any other state.</p><p id="m59750-fs-id1167470606975"><span id="m59750-fs-id1167470606975"> </span>This is not to say that our current scientific models and laws cannot change. New experiments and observations can lead to new, more sophisticated models&#8212;models that can include new phenomena and laws about their behavior. The general theory of relativity proposed by Albert Einstein is a perfect example of such a transformation that took place about a century ago; it led us to predict, and eventually to observe, a strange new class of objects that astronomers call <span class="emphasis"><em>black holes</em></span>. Only the patient process of observing nature ever more carefully and precisely can demonstrate the validity of such new scientific models.</p><p id="m59750-fs-id1167470762302"><span id="m59750-fs-id1167470762302"> </span>One important problem in describing scientific models has to do with the limitations of language. When we try to describe complex phenomena in everyday terms, the words themselves may not be adequate to do the job. For example, you may have heard the structure of the atom likened to a miniature solar system. While some aspects of our modern model of the atom do remind us of planetary orbits, many other of its aspects are fundamentally different.</p><p id="m59750-fs-id1167467242484"><span id="m59750-fs-id1167467242484"> </span>This problem is the reason scientists often prefer to describe their models using equations rather than words. In this book, which is designed to introduce the field of astronomy, we use mainly words to discuss what scientists have learned. We avoid complex math, but if this course piques your interest and you go on in science, more and more of your studies will involve the precise language of mathematics.</p></div><div xml:lang="en" class="section module" id="m59751"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 id="m59751"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated"/><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-n">1.4</span><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated">.&#160;</span><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t">Numbers in Astronomy<sup><a href="co03.html#book-attribution-m59751">*</a></sup></span></h2></div><div class="abstract"><div class="title"><span><span class="cnx-gentext-abstract cnx-gentext-autogenerated"/><span class="cnx-gentext-abstract cnx-gentext-t"/></span></div><p/></div></div></div><p id="m59751-fs-id1167470976282"><span id="m59751-fs-id1167470976282"> </span>In astronomy we deal with distances on a scale you may never have thought about before, with numbers larger than any you may have encountered. We adopt two approaches that make dealing with astronomical numbers a little bit easier. First, we use a system for writing large and small numbers called <span class="emphasis"><em>scientific notation</em></span> (or sometimes <span class="emphasis"><em>powers-of-ten notation</em></span>). This system is very appealing because it eliminates the many zeros that can seem overwhelming to the reader. In scientific notation, if you want to write a number such as 500,000,000, you express it as 5 &#215; 10<sup>8</sup>. The small raised number after the 10, called an <span class="emphasis"><em>exponent</em></span>, keeps track of the number of places we had to move the decimal point to the left to convert 500,000,000 to 5.

Because light always travels at the same speed, and because its speed turns out to be the fastest possible speed in the universe, it makes a good standard for keeping track of distances. You might be confused because a &#8220;light-year&#8221; seems to imply that we are measuring time, but this mix-up of time and distance is common in everyday life as well. For example, when your friend asks where the movie theater is located, you might say &#8220;about 20 minutes from downtown.&#8221;</p><p id="m59751-fs-id1167470753198"><span id="m59751-fs-id1167470753198"> </span>So, how many kilometers are there in a light-year?

Information about the universe comes to us almost exclusively through various forms of light, and all such light travels at the speed of light&#8212;that is, 1 light-year every year. This sets a limit on how quickly we can learn about events in the universe. If a star is 100 light-years away, the light we see from it tonight left that star 100 years ago and is just now arriving in our neighborhood. The soonest we can learn about any changes in that star is 100 years after the fact. For a star 500 light-years away, the light we detect tonight left 500 years ago and is carrying 500-year-old news.</p><p id="m59752-fs-id1167471071669"><span id="m59752-fs-id1167471071669"> </span>Because many of us are accustomed to instant news from the Internet, some might find this frustrating.</p><p id="m59752-fs-id1167466083098"><span id="m59752-fs-id1167466083098"> </span>&#8220;You mean, when I see that star up there,&#8221; you ask, &#8220;I won&#8217;t know what&#8217;s actually happening there for another 500 years?&#8221;</p><p id="m59752-fs-id1167470591403"><span id="m59752-fs-id1167470591403"> </span>But this isn&#8217;t the most helpful way to think about the situation. For astronomers, <span class="emphasis"><em>now</em></span> is when the light reaches us here on Earth. There is no way for us to know anything about that star (or other object) until its light reaches us.</p><p id="m59752-fs-id1167470940707"><span id="m59752-fs-id1167470940707"> </span>But what at first may seem a great frustration is actually a tremendous benefit in disguise. If astronomers really want to piece together what has happened in the universe since its beginning, they must find evidence about each epoch (or period of time) of the past. Where can we find evidence today about cosmic events that occurred billions of years ago?</p><p id="m59752-fs-id1167467337229"><span id="m59752-fs-id1167467337229"> </span>The delay in the arrival of light provides an answer to this question. The farther out in space we look, the longer the light has taken to get here, and the longer ago it left its place of origin. By looking billions of light-years out into space, astronomers are actually seeing billions of years into the past. In this way, we can reconstruct the history of the cosmos and get a sense of how it has evolved over time.</p><p id="m59752-fs-id1167470941279"><span id="m59752-fs-id1167470941279"> </span>This is one reason why astronomers strive to build telescopes that can collect more and more of the faint light in the universe.

(We define the universe to be everything that exists that is accessible to our observations.) Galaxies stretch as far into space as our telescopes can see, many billions of them within the reach of modern instruments.

The bulk of the matter in each atom is found in the nucleus, which consists of positive protons and electrically neutral neutrons all bound tightly together in a very small space. Each element is defined by the number of protons in its atoms. Thus, any atom with 6 protons in its nucleus is called <span class="emphasis"><em>carbon</em></span>, any with 50 protons is called <span class="emphasis"><em>tin</em></span>, and any with 70 protons is called <span class="emphasis"><em>ytterbium</em></span>.

This is why we say that even solid matter is mostly space. The typical atom is far emptier than the solar system out to Neptune. (The distance from Earth to the Sun, for example, is only 100 times the size of the Sun.)

The fact that there are four forces (and not a million, or just one) has puzzled physicists and astronomers for many years and has led to a quest for a unified picture of nature.</p><div id="m59760-fs-id1167470923282" class="note astronomy link-to-learning"><div class="title"><span class="cnx-gentext-tip-t"/></div><div class="body"><p id="m59760-fs-id1167470696965"><span id="m59760-fs-id1167470696965"> </span>To construct an atom, particle by particle, check out this <a class="link" href="https://openstax.org/l/30buildanatom">guided animation</a> for building an atom.</p></div></div></div><div xml:lang="en" class="section module" id="m59762"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 id="m59762"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated"/><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-n">1.9</span><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated">.&#160;</span><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t">A Conclusion and a Beginning<sup><a href="co03.html#book-attribution-m59762">*</a></sup></span></h2></div><div class="abstract"><div class="title"><span><span class="cnx-gentext-abstract cnx-gentext-autogenerated"/><span class="cnx-gentext-abstract cnx-gentext-t"/></span></div><p/></div></div></div><div class="toc"><ul/></div><p id="m59762-fs-id1167471073713"><span id="m59762-fs-id1167471073713"> </span>If you are new to astronomy, you have probably reached the end of our brief tour in this chapter with mixed emotions.

And the beginnings of modern astronomy are a mere fraction of a second before the New Year.
