To reconstruct the early history of the solar system, we need cosmic fossils&#8212;materials that formed when our system was very young.

His discovery, which he named Ceres, was quickly followed by the detection of three other little planets in similar orbits.</p><p id="m59866-fs-id1168047298456"><span id="m59866-fs-id1168047298456"> </span>Clearly, there was not a single missing planet between Mars and Jupiter but rather a whole group of objects, each much smaller than our Moon. (An analogous discovery history has played out in slow motion in the outer solar system. Pluto was discovered beyond Neptune in 1930 and was initially called a planet, but early in the twenty-first century, several other similar objects were found. We now call all of them dwarf planets.)</p><p id="m59866-fs-id1168047300042"><span id="m59866-fs-id1168047300042"> </span>By 1890, more than 300 of these minor planets or <em class="glossterm" id="m59866-autoid-cnx2dbk-idm140481032939392"><span id="m59866-autoid-cnx2dbk-idm140481032939392"> </span>asteroids</em><a id="idm45983366707440" class="indexterm"/> had been discovered by sharp-eyed observers.

Originally, the names of asteroids were chosen from goddesses in Greek and Roman mythology. After exhausting these and other female names (including, later, those of spouses, friends, flowers, cities, and others), astronomers turned to the names of colleagues (and other people of distinction) whom they wished to honor. For example, asteroids 2410, 4859, and 68448 are named Morrison, Fraknoi, and Sidneywolff, for the three original authors of this textbook.</p><p id="m59866-fs-id1168047357056"><span id="m59866-fs-id1168047357056"> </span>The largest asteroid is <em class="glossterm no-emphasis" id="m59866-autoid-cnx2dbk-idm140481032935856"><span id="m59866-autoid-cnx2dbk-idm140481032935856"> </span>Ceres</em><a id="idm45983366700208" class="indexterm"/> (numbered 1), with a diameter just less than 1000 kilometers.

He hypothesized that each family may have resulted from the breakup of a larger body or, more likely, from the collision of two asteroids. Slight differences in the speeds with which the various fragments left the collision scene account for the small spread in orbits now observed for the different asteroids in a given family. Several dozen such families exist, and observations have shown that individual members of most families have similar compositions, as we would expect if they were fragments of a common parent.</p><div id="m59866-fs-id1168047612063" class="note astronomy link-to-learning"><div class="title"><span class="cnx-gentext-tip-t"/></div><div class="body"><p id="m59866-fs-id1168047947628"><span id="m59866-fs-id1168047947628"> </span>You can see a <a class="link" href="https://openstaxcollege.org/l/30anividastorb">dramatic animated video</a> showing the orbits of 100,000 asteroids found by one sky survey.

There are several ways to estimate the total number, even before they were individually located. One way is to look at the numbers of large craters on the dark lunar maria. Remember that these craters were made by impacts just like the ones we are considering. They are preserved on the Moon&#8217;s airless surface, whereas Earth soon erases the imprints of past impacts. Thus, the number of large craters on the Moon allows us to estimate how often impacts have occurred on both the Moon and Earth over the past several billion years. The number of impacts is directly related to the number of asteroids and comets on Earth-crossing orbits.</p><p id="m59867-fs-id1168048649064"><span id="m59867-fs-id1168048649064"> </span>Another approach is to see how often the surveys (which are automated searches for faint points of light that move among the stars) rediscover a previously known asteroid. At the beginning of a survey, all the NEAs it finds will be new. But as the survey becomes more complete, more and more of the moving points the survey cameras record will be <span class="emphasis"><em>rediscoveries.</em></span> The more rediscoveries each survey experiences, the more complete our inventory of these asteroids must be.</p><p id="m59867-fs-id1168048775287"><span id="m59867-fs-id1168048775287"> </span>We have been relieved to find that none of the NEAs discovered so far is on a trajectory that will impact Earth within the foreseeable future. However, we can&#8217;t speak for the handful of asteroids larger than 1 kilometer that have not yet been found, or for the much more numerous smaller ones. It is estimated that there are a million NEAs capable of hitting Earth that are smaller than 1 kilometer but still large enough to destroy a city, and our surveys have found fewer than 10% of them. Researchers who work with asteroid orbits estimate that for smaller (and therefore fainter) asteroids we are not yet tracking, we will have about a 5-second warning that one is going to hit Earth&#8212;in other words, we won&#8217;t see it until it enters the atmosphere. Clearly, this estimate gives us a lot of motivation to continue these surveys to track as many asteroids as possible.</p><p id="m59867-fs-id1168048359600"><span id="m59867-fs-id1168048359600"> </span>Though entirely predictable over times of a few centuries, the orbits of <em class="glossterm no-emphasis" id="m59867-autoid-cnx2dbk-idm140481037173344"><span id="m59867-autoid-cnx2dbk-idm140481037173344"> </span>Earth-approaching asteroids</em><a id="idm45983366348784" class="indexterm"/> are unstable over long time spans as they are tugged by the gravitational attractions of the planets. These objects will eventually meet one of two fates: either they will impact one of the terrestrial planets or the Sun, or they will be ejected gravitationally from the inner solar system due to a near-encounter with a planet. The probabilities of these two outcomes are about the same. The timescale for impact or ejection is only about a hundred million years, very short compared with the 4-billion-year age of the solar system.

If we ever found one of these asteroids on a collision course with us, we would need to deflect it so it would miss Earth. The most straightforward way to deflect it would be to crash a spacecraft into it, either slowing it or speeding it up, slightly changing its orbital period. If this were done several years before the predicted collision, the asteroid would miss the planet entirely&#8212;making an asteroid impact the only natural hazard that we could eliminate completely by the application of technology. Alternatively, such deflection could be done by exploding a nuclear bomb near the asteroid to nudge it off course.</p><p id="m59867-fs-id1168048322753"><span id="m59867-fs-id1168048322753"> </span>To achieve a successful deflection by either technique, we need to know more about the density and interior structure of the asteroid. A spacecraft impact or a nearby explosion would have a greater effect on a solid rocky asteroid such as Eros than on a loose rubble pile. Think of climbing a sand dune compared to climbing a rocky hill with the same slope. On the dune, much of our energy is absorbed in the slipping sand, so the climb is much more difficult and takes more energy.</p><p id="m59867-fs-id1168048459763"><span id="m59867-fs-id1168048459763"> </span>There is increasing international interest in the problem of asteroid impacts. The United Nations has formed two technical committees on planetary defense, recognizing that the entire planet is at risk from asteroid impacts. However, the fundamental problem remains one of finding NEAs in time for defensive measures to be taken. We must be able to find the next impactor before it finds us. And that&#8217;s a job for the astronomers.</p></div></div><div xml:lang="en" class="section module" id="m59868"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 id="m59868"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated"/><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-n">13.3</span><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated">.&#160;</span><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t">The &#8220;Long-Haired&#8221; Comets<sup><a href="co03.html#book-attribution-m59868">*</a></sup></span></h2></div><div class="abstract"><div class="title"><span><span class="cnx-gentext-abstract cnx-gentext-autogenerated"/><span class="cnx-gentext-abstract cnx-gentext-t"/></span></div><p/></div></div></div><div class="toc"><ul><li class="toc-section learning-objectives"><a href="#m59868-fs-id1168048484842" class="target-section"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t">Learning Objectives</span></a></li><li class="toc-section"><a href="#m59868-fs-id1168048655513" class="target-section"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t">Appearance of Comets</span></a></li><li class="toc-section"><a href="#m59868-fs-id1168048301362" class="target-section"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t">Comet Orbits</span></a></li><li class="toc-section"><a href="#m59868-fs-id1168048337185" class="target-section"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t">The Comet&#8217;s Nucleus</span></a></li><li class="toc-section"><a href="#m59868-fs-id1168048589937" class="target-section"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t">The Comet&#8217;s Atmosphere</span></a></li><li class="toc-section"><a href="#m59868-fs-id1168048732335" class="target-section"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t">The Rosetta Comet Mission</span></a></li></ul></div><div class="section learning-objectives" id="m59868-fs-id1168048484842"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 id="m59868-fs-id1168048484842"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated"/><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t">Learning Objectives</span></h3></div></div></div><p id="m59868-fs-id1168583210367"><span id="m59868-fs-id1168583210367"> </span>By the end of this section, you will be able to:</p><div class="itemizedlist" id="m59868-fs-id1168048726408"><span id="m59868-fs-id1168048726408"> </span><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p>Characterize the general physical appearance of comets</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Explain the range of cometary orbits</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Describe the size and composition of a typical comet&#8217;s nucleus</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Discuss the atmospheres of comets</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Summarize the discoveries of the Rosetta mission</p></li></ul></div></div><p id="m59868-fs-id1168048595314"><span id="m59868-fs-id1168048595314"> </span>Comets differ from asteroids primarily in their icy composition, a difference that causes them to brighten dramatically as they approach the Sun, forming a temporary atmosphere.

Comets have been observed from the earliest times: accounts of comets are found in the histories of virtually all ancient civilizations. The typical comet, however, is not spectacular in our skies, instead having the appearance of a rather faint, diffuse spot of light somewhat smaller than the Moon and many times less brilliant.

Unlike the planets, however, most comets appear at unpredictable times, which perhaps explain why they frequently inspired fear and superstition in earlier times. Comets typically remain visible for periods that vary from a couple of weeks to several months. We&#8217;ll say more about what they are made of and how they become visible after we discuss their motions.</p><p id="m59868-fs-id1168048744529"><span id="m59868-fs-id1168048744529"> </span>Note that still images of comets give the impression that they are moving rapidly across the sky, like a bright meteor or shooting star.

In particular, he noted that the orbits of the bright comets that had appeared in the years 1531, 1607, and 1682 were so similar that the three could well be the same comet, returning to perihelion (closest approach to the Sun) at average intervals of 76 years. If so, he predicted that the object should next return about 1758.

This happens for the typical comet somewhat beyond the orbit of Mars. The evaporating H<sub>2</sub>O in turn releases the dust that was mixed with the ice.

Astronomy is one of the very few fields of science where amateurs can still make a meaningful contribution, and the discovery of a comet is one of the most exciting ways they can establish their place in astronomical history. Don Machholz, a California amateur (and comet hunter) who has been making a study of comet discoveries, reported that between 1975 and 1995, 38% of all comets discovered were found by amateurs. Those 20 years yielded 67 comets for amateurs, or almost 4 per year. That might sound pretty encouraging to new comet hunters, until they learn that the average number of hours the typical amateur spent searching for a comet before finding one was about 420. Clearly, this is not an activity for impatient personalities.</p><p id="m59869-fs-id1168048750811"><span id="m59869-fs-id1168048750811"> </span>What do comet hunters do if they think they have found a new comet? First, they must check the object&#8217;s location in an atlas of the sky to make sure it really is a comet. Since the first sighting of a comet usually occurs when it is still far from the Sun and before it sports a significant tail, it will look like only a small, fuzzy patch. And through most amateur telescopes, so will nebulae (clouds of cosmic gas and dust) and galaxies (distant groupings of stars). Next, they must check that they have not come across a comet that is already known, in which case, they will only get a pat on the back instead of fame and glory. Then they must re-observe or re-image it sometime later to see whether its motion in the sky is appropriate for comets.</p><p id="m59869-fs-id1168048720154"><span id="m59869-fs-id1168048720154"> </span>Often, comet hunters who think they have made a discovery get another comet hunter elsewhere in the country to confirm it. If everything checks out, the place they contact is the Central Bureau for Astronomical Telegrams at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics in Cambridge, Massachusetts (http://www.cbat.eps.harvard.edu/). If the discovery is confirmed, the bureau will send the news out to astronomers and observatories around the world. One of the unique rewards of comet hunting is that the discoverer&#8217;s name becomes associated with the new comet&#8212;a bit of cosmic fame that few hobbies can match.</p><div id="m59869-OSC_Astro_13_04_David" class="figure"><div class="body"><div class="mediaobject" id="m59869-fs-id1168048299895"><span id="m59869-fs-id1168048299895"> </span><img src="m59869/OSC_Astro_13_04_David.jpg" alt="Photograph of David Levy."/></div></div><div class="title"><span class="cnx-gentext-figure cnx-gentext-autogenerated">Figure&#160;</span><span class="cnx-gentext-figure cnx-gentext-n">13.28</span><span class="cnx-gentext-figure cnx-gentext-autogenerated">.&#160;</span><span class="cnx-gentext-figure cnx-gentext-t">David Levy.</span></div><div class="caption">Amateur astronomer David Levy ranks third in the world for comet discoveries.

At the other extreme, it may collide with the Sun or come so close that it is destroyed on its first perihelion passage (several such collisions have been observed with space telescopes that monitor the Sun).

Seeing these large, impact explosions on Jupiter helps us to appreciate the disaster that would happen to our planet if we were hit by a comet or asteroid.</p><div id="m59869-OSC_Astro_13_04_Cloud" class="figure"><div class="body"><div class="mediaobject" id="m59869-fs-id1168048593230"><span id="m59869-fs-id1168048593230"> </span><img src="m59869/OSC_Astro_13_04_Cloud.jpg" alt="Impact Dust Cloud on Jupiter.

The rocky ones are generally called asteroids. Ceres is the largest asteroid; about 15 are larger than 250 kilometers and about 100,000 are larger than 1 kilometer. Most are in the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter. The presence of asteroid families in the belt indicates that many asteroids are the remnants of ancient collisions and fragmentation. The asteroids include both primitive and differentiated objects. Most asteroids are classed as C-type, meaning they are composed of carbonaceous materials. Dominating the inner belt are S-type (stony) asteroids, with a few M-type (metallic) ones. We have spacecraft images of several asteroids and returned samples from asteroid Itokawa. Recent observations have detected a number of asteroid moons, making it possible to measure the masses and densities of the asteroids they orbit. The two largest asteroids, Ceres and Vesta, have been extensively studied from orbit by the <span class="emphasis"><em>Dawn</em></span> spacecraft.</p></div></div><div class="section"><div class="title"><a href="#m59867"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated"/><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-n">13.2</span><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated">.&#160;</span><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t">Asteroids and Planetary Defense</span></a></div><div class="body"><p id="m59867-fs-id1168048549470"><span id="m59867-fs-id1168048549470"> </span>Near-Earth asteroids (NEAs), and near-Earth objects (NEOs) in general, are of interest in part because of their potential to hit Earth. They are on unstable orbits, and on timescales of 100 million years, they will either impact one of the terrestrial planets or the Sun, or be ejected. Most of them probably come from the asteroid belt, but some may be dead comets. NASA&#8217;s Spaceguard Survey has found 90% of the NEAs larger than 1 kilometer, and none of the ones found so far are on a collision course with Earth. Scientists are actively working on possible technologies for planetary defense in case any NEOs are found on a collision course with Earth years in advance. For now, the most important task is to continue our surveys, so we can find the next Earth impactor before it finds us.</p></div></div><div class="section"><div class="title"><a href="#m59868"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated"/><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-n">13.3</span><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated">.&#160;</span><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t">The &#8220;Long-Haired&#8221; Comets</span></a></div><div class="body"><p id="m59868-fs-id1168048741284"><span id="m59868-fs-id1168048741284"> </span>Halley first showed that some comets are on closed orbits and return periodically to swing around the Sun. The heart of a comet is its nucleus, a few kilometers in diameter and composed of volatiles (primarily frozen H<sub>2</sub>O) and solids (including both silicates and carbonaceous materials). Whipple first suggested this &#8220;dirty snowball&#8221; model in 1950; it has been confirmed by spacecraft studies of several comets. As the nucleus approaches the Sun, its volatiles evaporate (perhaps in localized jets or explosions) to form the comet&#8217;s head or atmosphere, which escapes at about 1 kilometer per second. The atmosphere streams away from the Sun to form a long tail. The ESA Rosetta mission to Comet P67 (Churyumov-Gerasimenko) has greatly increased our knowledge of the nature of the nucleus and of the process by which comets release water and other volatiles when heated by sunlight.</p></div></div><div class="section"><div class="title"><a href="#m59869"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated"/><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-n">13.4</span><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated">.&#160;</span><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t">The Origin and Fate of Comets and Related Objects</span></a></div><div class="body"><p id="m59869-fs-id1168048319504"><span id="m59869-fs-id1168048319504"> </span>Oort proposed in 1950 that long-period comets are derived from what we now call the Oort cloud, which surrounds the Sun out to about 50,000 AU (near the limit of the Sun&#8217;s gravitational sphere of influence) and contains between 10<sup>12</sup> and 10<sup>13</sup> comets. Comets also come from the Kuiper belt, a disk-shaped region beyond the orbit of Neptune, extending to 50 AU from the Sun. Comets are primitive bodies left over from the formation of the outer solar system. Once a comet is diverted into the inner solar system, it typically survives no more than a few thousand perihelion passages before losing all its volatiles. Some comets die spectacular deaths: Shoemaker-Levy 9, for example, broke into 20 pieces before colliding with Jupiter in 1994.</p></div></div></div><!--CNX: Start Area: "For Further Exploration"--><div class="cnx-eoc further-exploration"><div class="title"><span>For Further Exploration</span></div><div class="section empty"><div class="title"><a href="#m59865"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated"/><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-n">13.</span><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated">.&#160;</span><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t">Thinking Ahead</span></a></div><div class="body"/></div><div class="section empty"><div class="title"><a href="#m59866"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated"/><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-n">13.1</span><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated">.&#160;</span><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t">Asteroids</span></a></div><div class="body"/></div><div class="section empty"><div class="title"><a href="#m59867"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated"/><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-n">13.2</span><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated">.&#160;</span><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t">Asteroids and Planetary Defense</span></a></div><div class="body"/></div><div class="section empty"><div class="title"><a href="#m59868"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated"/><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-n">13.3</span><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated">.&#160;</span><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t">The &#8220;Long-Haired&#8221; Comets</span></a></div><div class="body"/></div><div class="section"><div class="title"><a href="#m59869"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated"/><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-n">13.4</span><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated">.&#160;</span><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t">The Origin and Fate of Comets and Related Objects</span></a></div><div class="body"><div class="section" id="m59869-fs-id1168048740508"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 id="m59869-fs-id1168048740508"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated"/><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t">Articles</span></h4></div></div></div><div class="section" id="m59869-fs-id1168046143495"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h5 id="m59869-fs-id1168046143495"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated"/><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t"><span class="emphasis"><em>Asteroids</em></span></span></h5></div></div></div><p id="m59869-fs-id1168048353196"><span id="m59869-fs-id1168048353196"> </span>Asphang, E. &#8220;The Small Planets.&#8221; <span class="emphasis"><em>Scientific American</em></span> (May 2000): 46.
