With hindsight, it is surprising that scientists were so shocked to discover that the universe is expanding. In fact, our theories of gravity demand that the universe must be either expanding or contracting. To show what we mean, let&#8217;s begin with a universe of finite size&#8212;say a giant ball of a thousand galaxies. All these galaxies attract each other because of their gravity. If they were initially stationary, they would inevitably begin to move closer together and eventually collide. They could avoid this collapse only if for some reason they happened to be moving away from each other at high speeds. In just the same way, only if a rocket is launched at high enough speed can it avoid falling back to Earth.</p><p id="m59976-fs-id1163973271837"><span id="m59976-fs-id1163973271837"> </span>The problem of what happens in an infinite universe is harder to solve, but <em class="glossterm no-emphasis" id="m59976-autoid-cnx2dbk-idm140481041972112"><span id="m59976-autoid-cnx2dbk-idm140481041972112"> </span>Einstein</em><a id="idm45983347915264" class="indexterm"/> (and others) used his <em class="glossterm no-emphasis" id="m59976-autoid-cnx2dbk-idm140481041971424"><span id="m59976-autoid-cnx2dbk-idm140481041971424"> </span>theory of general relativity</em><a id="idm45983347913264" class="indexterm"/> (which we described in <a class="link target-chapter" href="ch24.html#m59938" title="24..&#160;Thinking Ahead">Black Holes and Curved Spacetime</a>) to show that even infinite universes cannot be static.

To see how astronomers do this, let&#8217;s begin with an analogy. Suppose your astronomy class decides to have a party (a kind of &#8220;Big Bang&#8221;) at someone&#8217;s home to celebrate the end of the semester. Unfortunately, everyone is celebrating with so much enthusiasm that the neighbors call the police, who arrive and send everyone away at the same moment. You get home at 2 a.m., still somewhat upset about the way the party ended, and realize you forgot to look at your watch to see what time the police got there. But you use a map to measure that the distance between the party and your house is 40 kilometers. And you also remember that you drove the whole trip at a steady speed of 80 kilometers/hour (since you were worried about the police cars following you). Therefore, the trip must have taken:</p><div id="m59976-fs-id1163976730243" class="equation unnumbered"><span class="label">(29.1)</span><div class="mediaobject"><img src="m59976/_autogen-svg2png-0001.png" style="width:; height:; vertical-align:-10.064999999999998pt;"/></div></div><p id="m59976-fs-id1163973120451"><span id="m59976-fs-id1163973120451"> </span>So the party must have broken up at 1:30 a.m.</p><p id="m59976-fs-id1163976787248"><span id="m59976-fs-id1163976787248"> </span>No humans were around to look at their watches when the universe began, but we can use the same technique to estimate when the galaxies began moving away from each other.

Continuing with our end-of-the-semester-party analogy, this is equivalent to assuming that you traveled home from the party at a constant rate, when in fact this may not have been the case. At first, mad about having to leave, you may have driven fast, but then as you calmed down&#8212;and thought about police cars on the highway&#8212;you may have begun to slow down until you were driving at a more socially acceptable speed (such as 80 kilometers/hour).

It turns out that this is not a good assumption. Earlier in their thinking about this, astronomers expected that the rate of expansion should be slowing down. We know that matter creates gravity, whereby all objects pull on all other objects. The mutual attraction between galaxies was expected to slow the expansion as time passed. This means that, if gravity were the only force acting (a big <span class="emphasis"><em>if</em></span>, as we shall see in the next section), then the rate of expansion must have been faster in the past than it is today.

If the universe were nearly empty, the role of gravity would be minor. Then the deceleration would be close to zero, and the universe would have been expanding at a constant rate. But in a universe with any significant density of matter, the pull of gravity means that the rate of expansion should be slower now than it used to be. If we use the current rate of expansion to estimate how long it took the galaxies to reach their current separations, we will overestimate the age of the universe&#8212;just as we may have overestimated the time it took for you to get home from the party.</p></div><div class="section" id="m59976-fs-id1163973468382"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 id="m59976-fs-id1163973468382"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated"/><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t">A Universal Acceleration</span></h3></div></div></div><p id="m59976-fs-id1163976477518"><span id="m59976-fs-id1163976477518"> </span>Astronomers spent several decades looking for evidence that the expansion was decelerating, but they were not successful.

This type of supernova occurs when a white dwarf accretes enough material from a companion star to exceed the Chandrasekhar limit and then collapses and explodes.

It was shocking&#8212;and so revolutionary that their discovery received the 2011 Nobel Prize in Physics. What the researchers found was that these type Ia supernovae in distant galaxies were fainter than expected from Hubble&#8217;s law, given the measured redshifts of their host galaxies.

The light of the explosion has to travel a greater distance to reach us than if the expansion rate were constant. The farther the light travels, the fainter it appears.

One way is to count all the galaxies out to a given distance and use estimates of their masses, including dark matter, to calculate the average density. Such estimates indicate a density of about 1 to 2 &#215; 10<sup>&#8211;27</sup> kg/m<sup>3</sup> (10 to 20% of critical), which by itself is too small to stop the expansion.</p><p id="m59977-fs-id1163974535861"><span id="m59977-fs-id1163974535861"> </span>A lot of the dark matter lies outside the boundaries of galaxies, so this inventory is not yet complete.

And time is one thing this model of the universe has plenty of.

The most advanced ideas about the universe from a hundred years ago now strike us as rather primitive. It may well be that our best models of today will in a hundred or a thousand years also seem rather simplistic and that there are other factors determining the ultimate fate of the universe of which we are still completely unaware.</p></div></div></div><div class="section" id="m59977-fs-id1163975338400"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 id="m59977-fs-id1163975338400"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated"/><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t">Ages of Distant Galaxies</span></h3></div></div></div><p id="m59977-fs-id1163974503687"><span id="m59977-fs-id1163974503687"> </span>In the chapter on <a class="link target-chapter" href="ch26.html#m59956" title="26..&#160;Thinking Ahead">Galaxies</a>, we discussed how we can use <em class="glossterm no-emphasis" id="m59977-autoid-cnx2dbk-idm140481031335712"><span id="m59977-autoid-cnx2dbk-idm140481031335712"> </span>Hubble&#8217;s law</em><a id="idm45983347209392" class="indexterm"/> to measure the distance to a galaxy. But that simple method only works with galaxies that are not too far away. Once we get to large distances, we are looking so far into the past that we must take into account changes in the rate of the expansion of the universe. Since we cannot measure these changes directly, we must assume one of the models of the universe to be able to convert large redshifts into distances.</p><p id="m59977-fs-id1163974219055"><span id="m59977-fs-id1163974219055"> </span>This is why astronomers squirm when reporters and students ask them exactly how far away some newly discovered distant quasar or galaxy is. We really can&#8217;t give an answer without first explaining the model of the universe we are assuming in calculating it (by which time a reporter or student is long gone or asleep). Specifically, we must use a model that includes the change in the expansion rate with time. The key ingredients of the model are the amounts of matter, including dark matter, and the equivalent mass (according to <span class="emphasis"><em>E</em></span> = <span class="emphasis"><em>mc</em></span><sup>2</sup>) of the dark energy along with the Hubble constant.</p><p id="m59977-fs-id1163974240693"><span id="m59977-fs-id1163974240693"> </span>Elsewhere in this book, we have estimated the mass density of ordinary matter plus dark matter as roughly 0.3 times the critical density, and the mass equivalent of dark energy as roughly 0.7 times the critical density. We will refer to these values as the &#8220;standard model of the universe.&#8221; The latest (slightly improved) estimates for these values and the evidence for them will be given later in this chapter.

Three basic ideas hold the key to tracing the changes that occurred during the time just after the universe began. The first, as we have already mentioned, is that the universe cools as it expands. <a class="xref target-figure" href="ch29.html#m59978-OSC_Astro_29_03_Temp" title="Figure&#160;29.13.&#160;Temperature of the Universe.">Figure&#160;29.13</a> shows how the temperature changes with the passage of time. Note that a huge span of time, from a tiny fraction of a second to billions of years, is summarized in this diagram. In the first fraction of a second, the universe was unimaginably hot. By the time 0.01 second had elapsed, the temperature had dropped to 100 billion (10<sup>11</sup>) K. After about 3 minutes, it had fallen to about 1 billion (10<sup>9</sup>) K, still some 70 times hotter than the interior of the Sun. After a few hundred thousand years, the temperature was down to a mere 3000 K, and the universe has continued to cool since that time.</p><div id="m59978-OSC_Astro_29_03_Temp" class="figure"><div class="body"><div class="mediaobject" id="m59978-fs-id1163974556831"><span id="m59978-fs-id1163974556831"> </span><img src="m59978/OSC_Astro_29_03_Temp.jpg" alt="No Alt Text"/></div></div><div class="title"><span class="cnx-gentext-figure cnx-gentext-autogenerated">Figure&#160;</span><span class="cnx-gentext-figure cnx-gentext-n">29.13</span><span class="cnx-gentext-figure cnx-gentext-autogenerated">.&#160;</span><span class="cnx-gentext-figure cnx-gentext-t">Temperature of the Universe.</span></div><div class="caption">This graph shows how the temperature of the universe varies with time as predicted by the standard model of the Big Bang.

As we shall see in the next section, however, we have actually detected the feeble glow of radiation emitted at a time when the universe was a few hundred thousand years old. We can measure the characteristics of that radiation to learn what things were like long ago. Indeed, the fact that we have found this ancient glow is one of the strongest arguments in favor of the Big Bang model.</p><p id="m59978-fs-id1163975443476"><span id="m59978-fs-id1163975443476"> </span>The second step in understanding the evolution of the universe is to realize that at very early times, it was so hot that it contained mostly radiation (and not the matter that we see today). The photons that filled the universe could collide and produce material particles; that is, under the conditions just after the Big Bang, energy could turn into matter (and matter could turn into energy). We can calculate how much mass is produced from a given amount of energy by using Einstein&#8217;s formula <span class="emphasis"><em>E</em></span> = <span class="emphasis"><em>mc</em></span><sup>2</sup> (see the chapter on <a class="link target-chapter" href="ch16.html#m59880" title="16..&#160;Thinking Ahead">The Sun: A Nuclear Powerhouse</a>).</p><p id="m59978-fs-id1163975340688"><span id="m59978-fs-id1163975340688"> </span>The idea that energy could turn into matter in the universe at large is a new one for many students, since it is not part of our everyday experience. That&#8217;s because, when we compare the universe today to what it was like right after the Big Bang, we live in cold, hard times. The photons in the universe today typically have far-less energy than the amount required to make new matter. In the discussion on the source of the Sun&#8217;s energy in <a class="link target-chapter" href="ch16.html#m59880" title="16..&#160;Thinking Ahead">The Sun: A Nuclear Powerhouse</a>, we briefly mentioned that when subatomic particles of matter and <span class="emphasis"><em>antimatter</em></span> collide, they turn into pure energy.

This process has been observed in particle accelerators around the world. If we have enough energy, under the right circumstances, new particles of matter (and antimatter) are indeed created &#8212;and the conditions were right during the first few minutes after the expansion of the universe began.</p><p id="m59978-fs-id1163974373792"><span id="m59978-fs-id1163974373792"> </span>Our third key point is that the hotter the universe was, the more energetic were the photons available to make matter and antimatter (see <a class="xref target-figure" href="ch29.html#m59978-OSC_Astro_29_03_Temp" title="Figure&#160;29.13.&#160;Temperature of the Universe.">Figure&#160;29.13</a>).

By 4 minutes after the Big Bang, more helium was having trouble forming. The universe was still expanding and cooling down. After the formation of helium and some lithium, the temperature had dropped so low that the fusion of helium nuclei into still-heavier elements could not occur. No elements beyond lithium could form in the first few minutes. That 4-minute period was the end of the time when the entire universe was a fusion factory.

Furthermore, even the oldest stars and the most distant galaxies show significant amounts of helium. These observations find a natural explanation in the synthesis of helium by the Big Bang itself during the first few minutes of time.

It turns out that all of the deuterium (a hydrogen nucleus with a neutron in it) in the universe was formed during the first 4 minutes. In stars, any region hot enough to fuse two protons to form a deuterium nucleus is also hot enough to change it further&#8212;either by destroying it through a collision with an energetic photon or by converting it into helium through nuclear reactions.</p><p id="m59978-fs-id1163974243057"><span id="m59978-fs-id1163974243057"> </span>The amount of deuterium that can be produced in the first 4 minutes of creation depends on the density of the universe at the time deuterium was formed. If the density were relatively high, nearly all the deuterium would have been converted into helium through interactions with protons, just as it is in stars. If the density were relatively low, then the universe would have expanded and thinned out rapidly enough that some deuterium would have survived. The amount of deuterium we see today thus gives us a clue to the density of the universe when it was about 4 minutes old. Theoretical models can relate the density then to the density now; thus, measurements of the abundance of deuterium today can give us an estimate of the current density of the universe.</p><p id="m59978-fs-id1163974331078"><span id="m59978-fs-id1163974331078"> </span>The measurements of deuterium indicate that the present-day density of ordinary matter&#8212;protons and neutrons&#8212;is about 5 &#215; 10<sup>&#8211;28</sup> kg/m<sup>3</sup>. Deuterium can only provide an estimate of the density of ordinary matter because the abundance of deuterium is determined by the particles that interact to form it, namely protons and neutrons alone.

Because dark matter particles do not affect the production of deuterium, measurement of the deuterium abundance cannot tell us how much dark matter exists. Dark matter is made of some exotic kind of particle, not yet detected in any earthbound laboratory.

In losing energy, the photons became slightly colder than the overall average temperature at the time of decoupling. Vice versa, photons that were located in a slightly less dense portion of space lost less energy upon leaving it than other photons, thus appearing slightly hotter than average.

By the 1980s, it was becoming likely that most of the dark matter was made of something we had not yet detected on Earth. By the late 1990s, a variety of experiments had shown that we live in a critical -density universe and that dark energy contributes about 70% of what is required to reach critical density.

Some physics theories predict the existence of such particles. One class of these particles has been given the name WIMPs, which stands for <em class="glossterm" id="m59980-autoid-cnx2dbk-idm140481031909488"><span id="m59980-autoid-cnx2dbk-idm140481031909488"> </span>weakly interacting massive particles</em><a id="idm45983346788208" class="indexterm"/>. Since these particles do not participate in nuclear reactions leading to the production of deuterium, the deuterium abundance puts no limits on how many WIMPs might be in the universe. (A number of other exotic particles have also been suggested as prime constituents of dark matter, but we will confine our discussion to WIMPs as a useful example.)</p><p id="m59980-fs-id1163975465524"><span id="m59980-fs-id1163975465524"> </span>If large numbers of WIMPs do exist, then some of them should be passing through our physics laboratories right now. The trick is to catch them. Since by definition they interact only weakly (infrequently) with other matter, the chances that they will have a measurable effect are small. We don&#8217;t know the mass of these particles, but various theories suggest that it might be a few to a few hundred times the mass of a proton. If WIMPs are 60 times the mass of a proton, there would be about 10 million of them passing through your outstretched hand every second&#8212;with absolutely no effect on you. If that seems too mind-boggling, bear in mind that neutrinos interact weakly with ordinary matter, and yet we were able to &#8220;catch&#8221; them eventually.</p><p id="m59980-fs-id1163975479724"><span id="m59980-fs-id1163975479724"> </span>Despite the challenges, more than 30 experiments designed to detect WIMPS are in operation or in the planning stages. Predictions of how many times WIMPs might actually collide with the nucleus of an atom in the instrument designed to detect them are in the range of 1 event per year to 1 event per 1000 years per kilogram of detector. The detector must therefore be large. It must be shielded from radioactivity or other types of particles, such as neutrons, passing through it, and hence these detectors are placed in deep mines. The energy imparted to an atomic nucleus in the detector by collision with a WIMP will be small, and so the detector must be cooled to a very low temperature.</p><p id="m59980-fs-id1163974199153"><span id="m59980-fs-id1163974199153"> </span>The WIMP detectors are made out of crystals of germanium, silicon, or xenon. The detectors are cooled to a few thousandths of a degree&#8212;very close to absolute zero. That means that the atoms in the detector are so cold that they are scarcely vibrating at all. If a dark matter particle collides with one of the atoms, it will cause the whole crystal to vibrate and the temperature therefore to increase ever so slightly. Some other interactions may generate a detectable flash of light.</p><p id="m59980-fs-id1163974173860"><span id="m59980-fs-id1163974173860"> </span>A different kind of search for WIMPs is being conducted at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN, Europe&#8217;s particle physics lab near Geneva, Switzerland. In this experiment, protons collide with enough energy potentially to produce WIMPs. The LHC detectors cannot detect the WIMPs directly, but if WIMPs are produced, they will pass through the detectors, carrying energy away with them. Experimenters will then add up all the energy that they detect as a result of the collisions of protons to determine if any energy is missing.</p><p id="m59980-fs-id1163975295009"><span id="m59980-fs-id1163975295009"> </span>So far, none of these experiments has detected WIMPs.

The observations with WMAP, Planck, and other experiments give us information on the size of those density fluctuations. It turns out that the density variations we observe are too small to have formed galaxies so soon after the Big Bang. In the hot, early universe, energetic photons collided with hydrogen and helium, and kept them moving so rapidly that gravity was still not strong enough to cause the atoms to come together to form galaxies.

Suppose you are part of a motorcade of cars accompanied by police who lead you past each light, even if it is red. So, too, when the early universe was opaque, radiation interacted with ordinary matter, imparting energy to it and carrying it along, sweeping past the concentrations of dark matter. Now suppose the police leave the motorcade, which then encounters some red lights. The lights act as traffic traps; approaching cars now have to stop, and so they bunch up. Likewise, after the early universe became transparent, ordinary matter interacted with radiation only occasionally and so could fall into the dark matter traps.</p></div><div class="section" id="m59980-fs-id1163974604298"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 id="m59980-fs-id1163974604298"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated"/><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t">The Universe in a Nutshell</span></h3></div></div></div><p id="m59980-fs-id1163974177964"><span id="m59980-fs-id1163974177964"> </span>In the previous sections of this chapter, we traced the evolution of the universe progressively further back in time.

The rate of expansion of the universe was determined from measurements of nearby galaxies. Determinations of the abundances of deuterium, helium, and lithium based on nearby stars and galaxies were used to put limits on how much ordinary matter is in the universe. The motions of stars in galaxies and of galaxies within clusters of galaxies could only be explained if there were large quantities of dark matter. Measurements of supernovae that exploded when the universe was about half as old as it is now indicated that the rate of expansion of the universe has sped up since those explosions occurred. Observations of extremely faint galaxies show that galaxies had begun to form when the universe was only 400&#8211;500 million years old.

COBE, WMAP, Planck, and other instruments have been used to study the radiation that was emitted at that time and that is still visible today (the CMB).

The universe still contained no stars or galaxies, and so it entered what astronomers call &#8220;the dark ages&#8221; (since stars were not lighting up the darkness).

The quest to understand just how the universe of galaxies came to be will keep astronomers busy for a long time to come.</p></div></div><div xml:lang="en" class="section module" id="m59982"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 id="m59982"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated"/><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-n">29.7</span><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated">.&#160;</span><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t">The Anthropic Principle<sup><a href="co03.html#book-attribution-m59982">*</a></sup></span></h2></div><div class="abstract"><div class="title"><span><span class="cnx-gentext-abstract cnx-gentext-autogenerated"/><span class="cnx-gentext-abstract cnx-gentext-t"/></span></div><p/></div></div></div><div class="toc"><ul><li class="toc-section learning-objectives"><a href="#m59982-fs-id1163975670006" class="target-section"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t">Learning Objectives</span></a></li><li class="toc-section"><a href="#m59982-fs-id1163974429808" class="target-section"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t">Lucky Accidents</span></a></li><li class="toc-section"><a href="#m59982-fs-id1163974552028" class="target-section"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t">What Had to Be, Had to Be</span></a></li></ul></div><div class="section learning-objectives" id="m59982-fs-id1163975670006"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 id="m59982-fs-id1163975670006"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated"/><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t">Learning Objectives</span></h3></div></div></div><p id="m59982-fs-id1168582932412"><span id="m59982-fs-id1168582932412"> </span>By the end of this section, you will be able to:</p><div class="itemizedlist" id="m59982-fs-id1163975668742"><span id="m59982-fs-id1163975668742"> </span><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p>Name some properties of the universe that, if different, would have precluded the development of humans</p></li></ul></div></div><p id="m59982-fs-id1163974431855"><span id="m59982-fs-id1163974431855"> </span>Despite our uncertainties, we must admit that the picture we have developed about the evolution of our universe is a remarkable one. With new telescopes, we have begun to collect enough observational evidence that we can describe how the universe evolved from a mere fraction of a second after the expansion began. Although this is an impressive achievement, there are still some characteristics of the universe that we cannot explain. And yet, it turns out that if these characteristics were any different, we would not be here to ask about them. Let&#8217;s look at some of these &#8220;lucky accidents,&#8221; beginning with the observations of the cosmic microwave background (CMB).</p><div class="section" id="m59982-fs-id1163974429808"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 id="m59982-fs-id1163974429808"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated"/><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t">Lucky Accidents</span></h3></div></div></div><p id="m59982-fs-id1163975826179"><span id="m59982-fs-id1163975826179"> </span>As we described in this chapter, the CMB is radiation that was emitted when the universe was a few hundred thousand years old. Observations show that the temperature of the radiation varies from one region to another, typically by about 10 millionths of a degree, and these temperature differences signal small differences in density. But suppose the tiny, early fluctuations in density had been much smaller. Then calculations show that the pull of gravity near them would have been so small that no galaxies would ever have formed.</p><p id="m59982-fs-id1163974418616"><span id="m59982-fs-id1163974418616"> </span>What if the fluctuations in density had been much larger? Then it is possible that very dense regions would have condensed, and these would simply have collapsed directly to black holes without ever forming galaxies and stars. Even if galaxies had been able to form in such a universe, space would have been filled with intense X-rays and gamma rays, and it would have been difficult for life forms to develop and survive. The density of stars within galaxies would be so high that interactions and collisions among them would be frequent. In such a universe, any planetary systems could rarely survive long enough for life to develop.</p><p id="m59982-fs-id1163975566203"><span id="m59982-fs-id1163975566203"> </span>So for us to be here, the density fluctuations need to be &#8220;just right&#8221;&#8212;not too big and not too small.</p><p id="m59982-fs-id1163975741080"><span id="m59982-fs-id1163975741080"> </span>Another lucky accident is that the universe is finely balanced between expansion and contraction. It is expanding, but very slowly. If the expansion had been at a much higher rate, all of the matter would have thinned out before galaxies could form. If everything were expanding at a much slower rate, then gravity would have &#8220;won.&#8221; The expansion would have reversed and all of the matter would have recollapsed, probably into a black hole&#8212;again, no stars, no planets, no life.</p><p id="m59982-fs-id1163975738091"><span id="m59982-fs-id1163975738091"> </span>The development of life on Earth depends on still-luckier coincidences.

We owe our existence to the fact that there was slightly more matter than antimatter. (After most of the matter made contact with an equal amount of antimatter, turning into energy, a small amount of additional matter must have been present. We are all descendants of that bit of &#8220;unbalanced&#8221; matter.)</p><p id="m59982-fs-id1163974285116"><span id="m59982-fs-id1163974285116"> </span>If nuclear fusion reactions occurred at a somewhat faster rate than they actually do, then at the time of the initial fireball, all of the matter would have been converted from hydrogen into helium into carbon and all the way into iron (the most stable nucleus). That would mean that no stars would have formed, since the existence of stars depends on there being light elements that can undergo fusion in the main-sequence stage and make the stars shine. In addition, the structure of atomic nuclei had to be just right to make it possible for three helium atoms to come together easily to fuse carbon, which is the basis of life.

The heavy elements that are ejected in such explosions are essential ingredients of life here on Earth. If neutrinos did not interact with matter at all, they would escape from the cores of collapsing stars without causing the explosion. If neutrinos interacted strongly with matter, they would remain trapped in the stellar core.

Some of those universes might be stillborn, collapsing before any structure forms. Others may expand so quickly that they remain essentially featureless with no stars and galaxies. In other words, there may be a much larger multiverse that contains our own universe and many others. This multiverse (existing perhaps in more dimensions that we can become aware of) is infinite and eternal; it generates many, many inflating regions, each of which evolves into a separate universe, which may be completely unlike any of the other separate universes. Our universe is then the way it is because it is the only way it could be and have humans like ourselves in it to discover its properties and ask such questions.</p><div id="m59982-fs-id1163975769687" class="note astronomy link-to-learning"><div class="title"><span class="cnx-gentext-tip-t"/></div><div class="body"><p id="m59982-fs-id1163975567753"><span id="m59982-fs-id1163975567753"> </span>View the <a class="link" href="https://openstax.org/l/30mulcosinfla">2011 introductory talk</a> on the Multiverse and Cosmic Inflation by Dr. Anthony Aguirre of the University of California, part of the Silicon Valley Astronomy Lecture Series.</p></div></div><p id="m59982-fs-id1163971955630"><span id="m59982-fs-id1163971955630"> </span>It is difficult to know how to test these ideas since we can never make contact with any other universe.

The universe is expanding, and this is one of the key observational starting points for modern cosmological theories. Modern observations show that the rate of expansion has not been constant throughout the life of the universe. Initially, when galaxies were close together, the effects of gravity were stronger than the effects of dark energy, and the expansion rate gradually slowed. As galaxies moved farther apart, the influence of gravity on the expansion rate weakened. Measurements of distant supernovae show that when the universe was about half its current age, dark energy began to dominate the rate of expansion and caused it to speed up. In order to estimate the age of the universe, we must allow for changes in the rate of expansion. After allowing for these effects, astronomers estimate that all of the matter within the observable universe was concentrated in an extremely small volume 13.8 billion years ago, a time we call the Big Bang.</p></div></div><div class="section"><div class="title"><a href="#m59977"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated"/><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-n">29.2</span><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated">.&#160;</span><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t">A Model of the Universe</span></a></div><div class="body"><p id="m59977-fs-id1163974383097"><span id="m59977-fs-id1163974383097"> </span>For describing the large-scale properties of the universe, a model that is isotropic and homogeneous (same everywhere) is a pretty good approximation of reality. The universe is expanding, which means that the universe undergoes a change in scale with time; space stretches and distances grow larger by the same factor everywhere at a given time. Observations show that the mass density of the universe is less than the critical density. In other words, there is not enough matter in the universe to stop the expansion. With the discovery of dark energy, which is accelerating the rate of expansion, the observational evidence is strong that the universe will expand forever. Observations tell us that the expansion started about 13.8 billion years ago.</p></div></div><div class="section"><div class="title"><a href="#m59978"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated"/><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-n">29.3</span><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated">.&#160;</span><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t">The Beginning of the Universe</span></a></div><div class="body"><p id="m59978-fs-id1163974269900"><span id="m59978-fs-id1163974269900"> </span>Lema&#238;tre, Alpher, and Gamow first worked out the ideas that are today called the Big Bang theory. The universe cools as it expands. The energy of photons is determined by their temperature, and calculations show that in the hot, early universe, photons had so much energy that when they collided with one another, they could produce material particles. As the universe expanded and cooled, protons and neutrons formed first, then came electrons and positrons. Next, fusion reactions produced deuterium, helium, and lithium nuclei. Measurements of the deuterium abundance in today&#8217;s universe show that the total amount of ordinary matter in the universe is only about 5% of the critical density.</p></div></div><div class="section"><div class="title"><a href="#m59979"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated"/><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-n">29.4</span><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated">.&#160;</span><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t">The Cosmic Microwave Background</span></a></div><div class="body"><p id="m59979-fs-id1163975460669"><span id="m59979-fs-id1163975460669"> </span>When the universe became cool enough to form neutral hydrogen atoms, the universe became transparent to radiation. Scientists have detected the cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation from this time during the hot, early universe. Measurements with the COBE satellite show that the CMB acts like a blackbody with a temperature of 2.73 K. Tiny fluctuations in the CMB show us the seeds of large-scale structures in the universe. Detailed measurements of these fluctuations show that we live in a critical-density universe and that the critical density is composed of 31% matter, including dark matter, and 69% dark energy. Ordinary matter&#8212;the kinds of elementary particles we find on Earth&#8212;make up only about 5% of the critical density. CMB measurements also indicate that the universe is 13.8 billion years old.</p></div></div><div class="section"><div class="title"><a href="#m59980"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated"/><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-n">29.5</span><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated">.&#160;</span><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t">What Is the Universe Really Made Of?</span></a></div><div class="body"><p id="m59980-fs-id1163974345596"><span id="m59980-fs-id1163974345596"> </span>Twenty-seven percent of the critical density of the universe is composed of dark matter. To explain so much dark matter, some physics theories predict that additional types of particles should exist. One type has been given the name of WIMPs (weakly interacting massive particles), and scientists are now conducting experiments to try to detect them in the laboratory. Dark matter plays an essential role in forming galaxies. Since, by definition, these particles interact only very weakly (if at all) with radiation, they could have congregated while the universe was still very hot and filled with radiation. They would thus have formed gravitational traps that quickly attracted and concentrated ordinary matter after the universe became transparent, and matter and radiation decoupled. This rapid concentration of matter enabled galaxies to form by the time the universe was only 400&#8211;500 million years old.</p></div></div><div class="section"><div class="title"><a href="#m59981"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated"/><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-n">29.6</span><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated">.&#160;</span><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t">The Inflationary Universe</span></a></div><div class="body"><p id="m59981-fs-id1163976906804"><span id="m59981-fs-id1163976906804"> </span>The Big Bang model does not explain why the CMB has the same temperature in all directions.

We know the universe is expanding and the galaxies are thinning out, and so this model hypothesized that new matter was continually coming into existence to fill in the space between galaxies as they moved farther apart. If so, the infinite universe did not have to have a sudden beginning, but could simply exist forever in a steady state. Have your group discuss your reaction to this model.

Now suppose the time for intelligent life to evolve is ten times shorter than the main-sequence lifetime of the Sun. Would we be around?
