A star with a luminosity 10,000 times greater than that of the Sun can be seen without a telescope out to a distance of 5000 light-years. The volume of space included within a distance of 5000 light-years, however, is enormous; so even though highly luminous stars are intrinsically rare, many of them are readily visible to our unaided eye.</p><p id="m59898-fs-id1164754878424"><span id="m59898-fs-id1164754878424"> </span>The contrast between these two samples of stars, those that are close to us and those that can be seen with the unaided eye, is an example of a <em class="glossterm" id="m59898-autoid-cnx2dbk-idm140481001247712"><span id="m59898-autoid-cnx2dbk-idm140481001247712"> </span>selection effect</em><a id="idm45983361098752" class="indexterm"/>. When a population of objects (stars in this example) includes a great variety of different types, we must be careful what conclusions we draw from an examination of any particular subgroup. Certainly we would be fooling ourselves if we assumed that the stars visible to the unaided eye are characteristic of the general stellar population; this subgroup is heavily weighted to the most luminous stars. It requires much more effort to assemble a complete data set for the nearest stars, since most are so faint that they can be observed only with a telescope. However, it is only by doing so that astronomers are able to know about the properties of the vast majority of the stars, which are actually much smaller and fainter than our own Sun. In the next section, we will look at how we measure some of these properties.</p></div></div><div xml:lang="en" class="section module" id="m59899"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 id="m59899"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated"/><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-n">18.2</span><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated">.&#160;</span><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t">Measuring Stellar Masses<sup><a href="co03.html#book-attribution-m59899">*</a></sup></span></h2></div><div class="abstract"><div class="title"><span><span class="cnx-gentext-abstract cnx-gentext-autogenerated"/><span class="cnx-gentext-abstract cnx-gentext-t"/></span></div><p/></div></div></div><div class="toc"><ul><li class="toc-section learning-objectives"><a href="#m59899-fs-id1164755031454" class="target-section"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t">Learning Objectives</span></a></li><li class="toc-section"><a href="#m59899-fs-id1164755047508" class="target-section"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t">Binary Stars</span></a></li><li class="toc-section"><a href="#m59899-fs-id1164754867630" class="target-section"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t">Masses from the Orbits of Binary Stars</span></a></li><li class="toc-section"><a href="#m59899-fs-id1164754989310" class="target-section"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t">The Range of Stellar Masses</span></a></li><li class="toc-section"><a href="#m59899-fs-id1164755019856" class="target-section"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t">The Mass-Luminosity Relation</span></a></li></ul></div><div class="section learning-objectives" id="m59899-fs-id1164755031454"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 id="m59899-fs-id1164755031454"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated"/><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t">Learning Objectives</span></h3></div></div></div><p id="m59899-fs-id1168583215412"><span id="m59899-fs-id1168583215412"> </span>By the end of this section, you will be able to:</p><div class="itemizedlist" id="m59899-fs-id1164755021164"><span id="m59899-fs-id1164755021164"> </span><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p>Distinguish the different types of binary star systems</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Understand how we can apply Newton&#8217;s version of Kepler&#8217;s third law to derive the sum of <em class="glossterm no-emphasis" id="m59899-autoid-cnx2dbk-idm140481002614832"><span id="m59899-autoid-cnx2dbk-idm140481002614832"> </span>star mass</em><a id="idm45983361076288" class="indexterm"/>es in a binary star system</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Apply the relationship between stellar mass and stellar luminosity to determine the physical characteristics of a star</p></li></ul></div></div><p id="m59899-fs-id1164754963598"><span id="m59899-fs-id1164754963598"> </span>The mass of a star&#8212;how much material it contains&#8212;is one of its most important characteristics.

He was examining the spectrum of Mizar and found that the dark absorption lines in the brighter star&#8217;s spectrum were usually double. Not only were there two lines where astronomers normally saw only one, but the spacing of the lines was constantly changing. At times, the lines even became single. Pickering correctly deduced that the brighter component of Mizar, called Mizar A, is itself really two stars that revolve about each other in a period of 104 days.

But the relative orbital speeds of the two stars can tell us how much of the total mass each star has. As we saw in our seesaw analogy, the more massive star is closer to the center of mass and therefore has a smaller orbit. Therefore, it moves more slowly to get around in the same time compared to the more distant, lower-mass star. If we sort out the speeds relative to each other, we can sort out the masses relative to each other. In practice, we also need to know how the binary system is oriented in the sky to our line of sight, but if we do, and the just-described steps are carried out carefully, the result is a calculation of the masses of each of the two stars in the system.</p><p id="m59899-fs-id1164754994244"><span id="m59899-fs-id1164754994244"> </span>To summarize, a good measurement of the motion of two stars around a common center of mass, combined with the laws of gravity, allows us to determine the masses of stars in such systems.

(Perseus derives from <span class="emphasis"><em>Per Zeus</em></span>, meaning &#8220;fathered by Zeus.&#8221;) Set adrift with his mother by an (understandably) upset stepfather, Perseus grew up on an island in the Aegean Sea.

The Greek gods did not take kindly to being compared to mere mortals, and Athena turned Medusa into a gorgon: a hideous, evil creature with writhing snakes for hair and a face that turned anyone who looked at it into stone. Perseus was given the task of slaying this demon, which seemed like a pretty sure way to get him out of the way forever.</p><p id="m59900-fs-id1164753846169"><span id="m59900-fs-id1164753846169"> </span>But because Perseus had a god for a father, some of the other gods gave him tools for the job, including Athena&#8217;s reflective shield and the winged sandals of Hermes (Mercury in the Roman story). By flying over her and looking only at her reflection, Perseus was able to cut off Medusa&#8217;s head without ever looking at her directly. Taking her head (which, conveniently, could still turn onlookers to stone even without being attached to her body) with him, Perseus continued on to other adventures.</p><p id="m59900-fs-id1164753851314"><span id="m59900-fs-id1164753851314"> </span>He next came to a rocky seashore, where boasting had gotten another family into serious trouble with the gods. Queen Cassiopeia had dared to compare her own beauty to that of the Nereids, sea nymphs who were daughters of Poseidon (Neptune in Roman mythology), the god of the sea. Poseidon was so offended that he created a sea-monster named Cetus to devastate the kingdom. King Cepheus, Cassiopeia&#8217;s beleaguered husband, consulted the oracle, who told him that he must sacrifice his beautiful daughter Andromeda to the monster.</p><p id="m59900-fs-id1164753863776"><span id="m59900-fs-id1164753863776"> </span>When Perseus came along and found Andromeda chained to a rock near the sea, awaiting her fate, he rescued her by turning the monster to stone. (Scholars of mythology actually trace the essence of this story back to far-older legends from ancient Mesopotamia, in which the god-hero Marduk vanquishes a monster named Tiamat. Symbolically, a hero like Perseus or Marduk is usually associated with the Sun, the monster with the power of night, and the beautiful maiden with the fragile beauty of dawn, which the Sun releases after its nightly struggle with darkness.)</p><p id="m59900-fs-id1164753775852"><span id="m59900-fs-id1164753775852"> </span>Many of the characters in these Greek legends can be found as constellations in the sky, not necessarily resembling their namesakes but serving as reminders of the story.

The ancients imagined Andromeda still chained to her rock (it is much easier to see the chain of stars than to recognize the beautiful maiden in this star grouping). Perseus is next to her with the head of Medusa swinging from his belt. Algol represents this gorgon head and has long been associated with evil and bad fortune in such tales. Some commentators have speculated that the star&#8217;s change in brightness (which can be observed with the unaided eye) may have contributed to its unpleasant reputation, with the ancients regarding such a change as a sort of evil &#8220;wink.&#8221;</p></div></div></div><div class="section" id="m59900-fs-id1164753785405"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 id="m59900-fs-id1164753785405"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated"/><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t">Diameters of Eclipsing Binary Stars</span></h3></div></div></div><p id="m59900-fs-id1164753847435"><span id="m59900-fs-id1164753847435"> </span>We now turn back to the main thread of our story to discuss how all this can be used to measure the sizes of stars. The technique involves making a light curve of an eclipsing binary, a graph that plots how the brightness changes with time. Let us consider a hypothetical binary system in which the stars are very different in size, like those illustrated in <a class="xref target-figure" href="ch18.html#m59900-OSC_Astro_18_03_Light" title="Figure&#160;18.11.&#160;Light Curve of an Edge-On Eclipsing Binary.">Figure&#160;18.11</a>.

When the smaller star just starts to pass behind the larger star (a point we call <span class="emphasis"><em>first contact</em></span>), the brightness begins to drop. The eclipse becomes total (the smaller star is completely hidden) at the point called <span class="emphasis"><em>second contact</em></span>. At the end of the total eclipse (<span class="emphasis"><em>third</em></span> <span class="emphasis"><em>contact</em></span>)<span class="emphasis"><em>,</em></span> the smaller star begins to emerge.

During the time interval between the first and second contacts, the smaller star has moved a distance equal to its own diameter. During the time interval from the first to third contacts, the smaller star has moved a distance equal to the diameter of the larger star. If the spectral lines of both stars are visible in the spectrum of the binary, then the speed of the smaller star with respect to the larger one can be measured from the Doppler shift. But knowing the speed with which the smaller star is moving and how long it took to cover some distance can tell the span of that distance&#8212;in this case, the diameters of the stars. The speed multiplied by the time interval from the first to second contact gives the diameter of the smaller star.

It is difficult to plot an H&#8211;R diagram that is truly representative of all stars because most stars are so faint that we cannot see those outside our immediate neighborhood. The stars plotted in <a class="xref target-figure" href="ch18.html#m59901-OSC_Astro_18_04_Sample" title="Figure&#160;18.14.&#160;H&#8211;R Diagram for a Selected Sample of Stars.">Figure&#160;18.14</a> were selected because their distances are known. This sample omits many intrinsically faint stars that are nearby but have not had their distances measured, so it shows fewer faint main-sequence stars than a &#8220;fair&#8221; diagram would. To be truly representative of the stellar population, an H&#8211;R diagram should be plotted for all stars within a certain distance. Unfortunately, our knowledge is reasonably complete only for stars within 10 to 20 light-years of the Sun, among which there are no giants or supergiants. Still, from many surveys (and more can now be done with new, more powerful telescopes), we estimate that about 90% of the true stars overall (excluding brown dwarfs) in our part of space are main-sequence stars, about 10% are white dwarfs, and fewer than 1% are giants or supergiants.</p><p id="m59901-fs-id1164754898053"><span id="m59901-fs-id1164754898053"> </span>These estimates can be used directly to understand the lives of stars. Permit us another quick analogy with people. Suppose we survey people just like astronomers survey stars, but we want to focus our attention on the location of young people, ages 6 to 18 years. Survey teams fan out and take data about where such youngsters are found at all times during a 24-hour day. Some are found in the local pizza parlor, others are asleep at home, some are at the movies, and many are in school. After surveying a very large number of young people, one of the things that the teams determine is that, averaged over the course of the 24 hours, one-third of all youngsters are found in school.</p><p id="m59901-fs-id1164754920602"><span id="m59901-fs-id1164754920602"> </span>How can they interpret this result? Does it mean that two-thirds of students are truants and the remaining one-third spend all their time in school? No, we must bear in mind that the survey teams counted youngsters throughout the full 24-hour day. Some survey teams worked at night, when most youngsters were at home asleep, and others worked in the late afternoon, when most youngsters were on their way home from school (and more likely to be enjoying a pizza). If the survey was truly representative, we <span class="emphasis"><em>can</em></span> conclude, however, that if an average of one-third of all youngsters are found in school, then humans ages 6 to 18 years must spend about one-third of <span class="emphasis"><em>their time</em></span> in school.</p><p id="m59901-fs-id1164755040740"><span id="m59901-fs-id1164755040740"> </span>We can do something similar for stars. We find that, on average, 90% of all stars are located on the main sequence of the H&#8211;R diagram.

The fusion of protons to helium is an excellent, long-lasting source of energy for a star because the bulk of every star consists of hydrogen atoms, whose nuclei are protons.</p><p id="m59901-fs-id1164754973422"><span id="m59901-fs-id1164754973422"> </span>Our computer models of how stars evolve over time show us that a typical star will spend about 90% of its life fusing the abundant hydrogen in its core into helium.

Astrophysicists have been able to show that the structure of stars that are in equilibrium and derive all their energy from nuclear fusion is completely and uniquely determined by just two quantities: the <span class="emphasis"><em>total mass</em></span> and the <span class="emphasis"><em>composition</em></span> of the star.

In such a cloud, all the clumps of gas and dust that become stars begin with the same chemical composition and differ from one another only in mass. Now suppose that we compute a model of each of these stars for the time at which it becomes stable and derives its energy from nuclear reactions, but before it has time to alter its composition appreciably as a result of these reactions.</p><p id="m59901-fs-id1164754897108"><span id="m59901-fs-id1164754897108"> </span>The models calculated for these stars allow us to determine their luminosities, temperatures, and sizes.

As we will see in the next few chapters, these are what main-sequence stars turn into as they age: They are the later stages in a star&#8217;s life. As a star consumes its nuclear fuel, its source of energy changes, as do its chemical composition and interior structure. These changes cause the star to alter its luminosity and surface temperature so that it no longer lies on the main sequence on our diagram. Because stars spend much less time in these later stages of their lives, we see fewer stars in those regions of the H&#8211;R diagram.</p></div><div class="section" id="m59901-fs-id1164754997938"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 id="m59901-fs-id1164754997938"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated"/><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t">Extremes of Stellar Luminosities, Diameters, and Densities</span></h3></div></div></div><p id="m59901-fs-id1164755012037"><span id="m59901-fs-id1164755012037"> </span>We can use the H&#8211;R diagram to explore the extremes in size, luminosity, and density found among the stars.

We know of a few extreme stars that are a million times more luminous than the Sun, with masses that exceed 100 times the Sun&#8217;s mass.

We call such a star a dwarf because its diameter is only 1/10 that of the Sun. A star with such a low luminosity also has a low mass (about 1/12 that of the Sun). This combination of mass and diameter means that it is so compressed that the star has an average density about 80 times that of the Sun. Its density must be higher, in fact, than that of any known solid found on the surface of Earth.

In visual binaries, the two stars can be seen separately in a telescope, whereas in a spectroscopic binary, only the spectrum reveals the presence of two stars. Stellar masses range from about 1/12 to more than 100 times the mass of the Sun (in rare cases, going to 250 times the Sun&#8217;s mass). Objects with masses between 1/12 and 1/100 that of the Sun are called brown dwarfs. Objects in which no nuclear reactions can take place are planets. The most massive stars are, in most cases, also the most luminous, and this correlation is known as the mass-luminosity relation.</p></div></div><div class="section"><div class="title"><a href="#m59900"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated"/><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-n">18.3</span><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated">.&#160;</span><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t">Diameters of Stars</span></a></div><div class="body"><p id="m59900-fs-id1164753839013"><span id="m59900-fs-id1164753839013"> </span>The diameters of stars can be determined by measuring the time it takes an object (the Moon, a planet, or a companion star) to pass in front of it and block its light.

Most stars lie on the main sequence, which extends diagonally across the H&#8211;R diagram from high temperature and high luminosity to low temperature and low luminosity. The position of a star along the main sequence is determined by its mass. High-mass stars emit more energy and are hotter than low-mass stars on the main sequence. Main-sequence stars derive their energy from the fusion of protons to helium. About 90% of the stars lie on the main sequence. Only about 10% of the stars are white dwarfs, and fewer than 1% are giants or supergiants.</p></div></div></div><!--CNX: Start Area: "For Further Exploration"--><div class="cnx-eoc further-exploration"><div class="title"><span>For Further Exploration</span></div><div class="section empty"><div class="title"><a href="#m59897"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated"/><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-n">18.</span><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated">.&#160;</span><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t">Thinking Ahead</span></a></div><div class="body"/></div><div class="section empty"><div class="title"><a href="#m59898"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated"/><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-n">18.1</span><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated">.&#160;</span><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t">A Stellar Census</span></a></div><div class="body"/></div><div class="section empty"><div class="title"><a href="#m59899"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated"/><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-n">18.2</span><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated">.&#160;</span><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t">Measuring Stellar Masses</span></a></div><div class="body"/></div><div class="section empty"><div class="title"><a href="#m59900"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated"/><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-n">18.3</span><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated">.&#160;</span><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t">Diameters of Stars</span></a></div><div class="body"/></div><div class="section"><div class="title"><a href="#m59901"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated"/><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-n">18.4</span><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated">.&#160;</span><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t">The H&#8211;R Diagram</span></a></div><div class="body"><div class="section" id="m59901-fs-id1164754963958"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 id="m59901-fs-id1164754963958"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated"/><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t">Articles</span></h4></div></div></div><p id="m59901-fs-id1164755037320"><span id="m59901-fs-id1164755037320"> </span>Croswell, K. &#8220;The Periodic Table of the Cosmos.&#8221; <span class="emphasis"><em>Scientific American</em></span> (July 2011):45&#8211;49.
