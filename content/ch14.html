Since the particles move at speeds of many kilometers per second, friction with the air vaporizes them at altitudes between 80 and 130 kilometers. The resulting flashes of light fade out within a few seconds. These &#8220;shooting stars&#8221; got their name because at night their luminous vapors look like stars moving rapidly across the sky. To be visible, a meteor must be within about 200 kilometers of the observer. On a typical dark, moonless night, an alert observer can see half a dozen meteors per hour. These <span class="emphasis"><em>sporadic meteors</em></span>&#8212;those not associated with a meteor shower (explained in the next section)&#8212;are random occurrences. Over the entire Earth, the total number of meteors bright enough to be visible totals about 25 million per day.</p><p id="m59871-fs-id1163975333822"><span id="m59871-fs-id1163975333822"> </span>The typical meteor is produced by a particle with a mass of less than 1 gram&#8212;no larger than a pea. How can we see such a small particle? The light you see comes from the much larger region of heated, glowing gas surrounding this little grain of interplanetary material. Because of its high speed, the energy in a pea-sized meteor is as great as that of an artillery shell fired on Earth, but this energy is dispersed high in Earth&#8217;s atmosphere. (When these tiny projectiles hit an airless body like the Moon, they do make small craters and generally pulverize the surface.)</p><p id="m59871-fs-id1163975728050"><span id="m59871-fs-id1163975728050"> </span>If a particle the size of a golf ball strikes our atmosphere, it produces a much brighter trail called a fireball (<a class="xref target-figure" href="ch14.html#m59871-OSC_Astro_14_01_Fireball" title="Figure&#160;14.2.&#160;Fireball.">Figure&#160;14.2</a>). A piece as large as a bowling ball has a fair chance of surviving its fiery entry if its approach speed is not too high. The total mass of meteoric material entering Earth&#8217;s atmosphere is estimated to be about 100 tons per day (which seems like a lot if you imagine it all falling in one place, but remember it is spread out all over our planet&#8217;s surface).</p><div id="m59871-OSC_Astro_14_01_Fireball" class="figure"><div class="body"><div class="mediaobject" id="m59871-fs-id1163975577785"><span id="m59871-fs-id1163975577785"> </span><img src="m59871/OSC_Astro_14_01_Fireball.jpg" alt="A photo of a falling meteor with a trail of light behind it."/></div></div><div class="title"><span class="cnx-gentext-figure cnx-gentext-autogenerated">Figure&#160;</span><span class="cnx-gentext-figure cnx-gentext-n">14.2</span><span class="cnx-gentext-figure cnx-gentext-autogenerated">.&#160;</span><span class="cnx-gentext-figure cnx-gentext-t">Fireball.</span></div><div class="caption">When a larger piece of cosmic material strikes Earth&#8217;s atmosphere, it can make a bright fireball.

The dust particles from a given comet retain approximately the orbit of their parent, continuing to move together through space but spreading out over the orbit with time.

For example, a very clumpy distribution is associated with the Leonid meteors, which in 1833 and again in 1866 (after an interval of 33 years&#8212;the period of the comet) yielded the most spectacular showers (sometimes called <span class="emphasis"><em>meteor storms</em></span>) ever recorded (<a class="xref target-figure" href="ch14.html#m59871-OSC_Astro_14_01_Storm" title="Figure&#160;14.4.&#160;Leonid Meteor Storm.">Figure&#160;14.4</a>).

In the absence of bright moonlight, you can see one meteor every few minutes during a typical Perseid shower. Astronomers estimate that the total combined mass of the particles in the Perseid swarm is nearly a billion tons; the comet that gave rise to the particles in that swarm, called Swift-Tuttle, must originally have had at least that much mass. However, if its initial mass were comparable to the mass measured for Comet Halley, then Swift-Tuttle would have contained several hundred billion tons, suggesting that only a very small fraction of the original cometary material survives in the meteor stream.</p><div id="m59871-fs-id1163975533197" class="note astronomy link-to-learning"><div class="title"><span class="cnx-gentext-tip-t"/></div><div class="body"><p id="m59871-fs-id1163975364829"><span id="m59871-fs-id1163975364829"> </span>The California Academy of Sciences has a short animated <a class="link" href="https://openstaxcollege.org/l/30howobsmetsho">guide</a> on &#8220;How to Observe a Meteor Shower.&#8221;</p></div></div><p id="m59871-fs-id1163975338832"><span id="m59871-fs-id1163975338832"> </span>No shower meteor has ever survived its flight through the atmosphere and been recovered for laboratory analysis.

We can also infer this from the tiny comet particles recovered in Earth&#8217;s atmosphere with high-flying aircraft (see <a class="xref target-figure" href="ch13.html#m59868-OSC_Astro_13_03_Dust" title="Figure&#160;13.19.&#160;Captured Comet Dust.">Figure&#160;13.19</a>).

In September 1938, for example, a meteorite plunged through the roof of Edward McCain&#8217;s garage, where it became embedded in the seat of his Pontiac Coupe (<a class="xref target-figure" href="ch14.html#m59872-OSC_Astro_14_02_Benld" title="Figure&#160;14.8.&#160;Benld Meteorite.">Figure&#160;14.8</a>).</p><p id="m59872-fs-id1163975465876"><span id="m59872-fs-id1163975465876"> </span>In November 1982, Robert and Wanda Donahue of Wethersfield, Connecticut, were watching <span class="emphasis"><em>M*A*S*H*</em></span> on television when a 6-pound meteorite came thundering through their roof, making a hole in the living room ceiling.

Before Martin, the most recent person known to have been struck by a meteorite was Annie Hodges of Sylacauga, Alabama.

Almost all meteorites have radioactive ages between 4.50 and 4.56 billion years, as old as any ages we have measured in the solar system.

More scientifically significant, however, is the distinction between <span class="emphasis"><em>primitive</em></span> and <span class="emphasis"><em>differentiated</em></span> meteorites. The differentiated meteorites are fragments of larger parent bodies that were molten before they broke up, allowing the denser materials (such as metals) to sink to their centers. Like many rocks on Earth, they have been subject to a degree of chemical reshuffling, with the different materials sorted according to density. Differentiated meteorites include the irons, which come from the metal cores of their parent bodies; stony-irons, which probably originate in regions between a metal core and a stony mantle; and some stones that are composed of mantle or crust material from the their differentiated parent bodies.</p></div><div class="section" id="m59872-fs-id1163975389330"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 id="m59872-fs-id1163975389330"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated"/><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t">The Most Primitive Meteorites</span></h3></div></div></div><p id="m59872-fs-id1163975715282"><span id="m59872-fs-id1163975715282"> </span>For information on the <span class="emphasis"><em>earliest</em></span> history of the solar system, we turn to the <em class="glossterm no-emphasis" id="m59872-autoid-cnx2dbk-idm140480989906416"><span id="m59872-autoid-cnx2dbk-idm140480989906416"> </span>primitive meteorites</em><a id="idm45983365092640" class="indexterm"/>&#8212;those made of materials that have <span class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> been subject to great heat or pressure since their formation.

But after Earth&#8217;s surface cooled, the asteroid and comet fragments that pelted it could have refreshed its supply of organic materials.</p></div></div><div xml:lang="en" class="section module" id="m59873"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 id="m59873"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated"/><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-n">14.3</span><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated">.&#160;</span><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t">Formation of the Solar System<sup><a href="co03.html#book-attribution-m59873">*</a></sup></span></h2></div><div class="abstract"><div class="title"><span><span class="cnx-gentext-abstract cnx-gentext-autogenerated"/><span class="cnx-gentext-abstract cnx-gentext-t"/></span></div><p/></div></div></div><div class="toc"><ul><li class="toc-section learning-objectives"><a href="#m59873-fs-id1163975686059" class="target-section"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t">Learning Objectives</span></a></li><li class="toc-section"><a href="#m59873-fs-id1163975370995" class="target-section"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t">Observational Constraints</span></a></li><li class="toc-section"><a href="#m59873-fs-id1163975382428" class="target-section"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t">The Solar Nebula</span></a></li><li class="toc-section"><a href="#m59873-fs-id1163975573681" class="target-section"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t">Formation of the Terrestrial Planets</span></a></li><li class="toc-section"><a href="#m59873-fs-id1163975639124" class="target-section"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t">Formation of the Giant Planets</span></a></li><li class="toc-section"><a href="#m59873-fs-id1163975767306" class="target-section"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t">Further Evolution of the System</span></a></li></ul></div><div class="section learning-objectives" id="m59873-fs-id1163975686059"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 id="m59873-fs-id1163975686059"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated"/><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t">Learning Objectives</span></h3></div></div></div><p id="m59873-fs-id1168584126653"><span id="m59873-fs-id1168584126653"> </span>By the end of this section, you will be able to:</p><div class="itemizedlist" id="m59873-fs-id1163975323387"><span id="m59873-fs-id1163975323387"> </span><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p>Describe the motion, chemical, and age constraints that must be met by any theory of solar system formation</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Summarize the physical and chemical changes during the solar nebula stage of solar system formation</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Explain the formation process of the terrestrial and giant planets</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Describe the main events of the further evolution of the solar system</p></li></ul></div></div><p id="m59873-fs-id1163975381794"><span id="m59873-fs-id1163975381794"> </span>As we have seen, the <em class="glossterm no-emphasis" id="m59873-autoid-cnx2dbk-idm140481035687552"><span id="m59873-autoid-cnx2dbk-idm140481035687552"> </span>comets</em><a id="idm45983365048304" class="indexterm"/>, <em class="glossterm no-emphasis" id="m59873-autoid-cnx2dbk-idm140481035686832"><span id="m59873-autoid-cnx2dbk-idm140481035686832"> </span>asteroids</em><a id="idm45983365046400" class="indexterm"/>, and meteorites are surviving remnants from the processes that formed the solar system.

These may be summarized under three categories: motion constraints, chemical constraints, and age constraints. We call them <span class="emphasis"><em>constraints</em></span> because they place restrictions on our theories; unless a theory can explain the observed facts, it will not survive in the competitive marketplace of ideas that characterizes the endeavor of science. Let&#8217;s take a look at these constraints one by one.</p><p id="m59873-fs-id1163975697372"><span id="m59873-fs-id1163975697372"> </span>There are many regularities to the motions in the solar system. We saw that the planets all revolve around the Sun in the same direction and approximately in the plane of the Sun&#8217;s own rotation. In addition, most of the planets rotate in the same direction as they revolve, and most of the moons also move in counterclockwise orbits (when seen from the north). With the exception of the comets and other trans-neptunian objects, the motions of the system members define a disk or Frisbee shape. Nevertheless, a full theory must also be prepared to deal with the exceptions to these trends, such as the <span class="emphasis"><em>retrograde rotation</em></span> (not revolution) of Venus.</p><p id="m59873-fs-id1163975530165"><span id="m59873-fs-id1163975530165"> </span>In the realm of chemistry, we saw that Jupiter and Saturn have approximately the same composition&#8212;dominated by hydrogen and helium. These are the two largest planets, with sufficient gravity to hold on to any gas present when and where they formed; thus, we might expect them to be representative of the original material out of which the solar system formed. Each of the other members of the planetary system is, to some degree, lacking in the light elements. A careful examination of the composition of solid solar-system objects shows a striking progression from the metal-rich inner planets, through those made predominantly of rocky materials, out to objects with ice-dominated compositions in the outer solar system. The comets in the Oort cloud and the trans-neptunian objects in the Kuiper belt are also icy objects, whereas the asteroids represent a transitional rocky composition with abundant dark, carbon-rich material.</p><p id="m59873-fs-id1163975493474"><span id="m59873-fs-id1163975493474"> </span>As we saw in <a class="link target-chapter" href="ch07.html#m59814" title="7..&#160;Thinking Ahead">Other Worlds: An Introduction to the Solar System</a>, this general chemical pattern can be interpreted as a temperature sequence: hot near the Sun and cooler as we move outward. The inner parts of the system are generally missing those materials that could not condense (form a solid) at the high temperatures found near the Sun. However, there are (again) important exceptions to the general pattern. For example, it is difficult to explain the presence of water on Earth and Mars if these planets formed in a region where the temperature was too hot for ice to condense, unless the ice or water was brought in later from cooler regions. The extreme example is the observation that there are polar deposits of ice on both Mercury and the Moon; these are almost certainly formed and maintained by occasional comet impacts.</p><p id="m59873-fs-id1163975289948"><span id="m59873-fs-id1163975289948"> </span>As far as age is concerned, we discussed that radioactive dating demonstrates that some rocks on the surface of Earth have been present for at least 3.8 billion years, and that certain lunar samples are 4.4 billion years old. The primitive meteorites all have radioactive ages near 4.5 billion years. The age of these unaltered building blocks is considered the age of the planetary system. The similarity of the measured ages tells us that planets formed and their crusts cooled within a few tens of millions of years (at most) of the beginning of the solar system. Further, detailed examination of primitive meteorites indicates that they are made primarily from material that condensed or coagulated out of a hot gas; few identifiable fragments appear to have survived from before this hot-vapor stage 4.5 billion years ago.</p></div><div class="section" id="m59873-fs-id1163975382428"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 id="m59873-fs-id1163975382428"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated"/><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t">The Solar Nebula</span></h3></div></div></div><p id="m59873-fs-id1163975372653"><span id="m59873-fs-id1163975372653"> </span>All the foregoing constraints are consistent with the general idea, introduced in <a class="link target-chapter" href="ch07.html#m59814" title="7..&#160;Thinking Ahead">Other Worlds: An Introduction to the Solar System</a>, that the solar system formed 4.5 billion years ago out of a rotating cloud of vapor and dust&#8212;which we call the <em class="glossterm no-emphasis" id="m59873-autoid-cnx2dbk-idm140481025411200"><span id="m59873-autoid-cnx2dbk-idm140481025411200"> </span>solar nebula</em><a id="idm45983365026448" class="indexterm"/>&#8212;with an initial composition similar to that of the Sun today.

Like a figure skater pulling her arms in to spin faster, the shrinking cloud spun more quickly as time went on. Now, think about how a round object spins. Close to the poles, the spin rate is slow, and it gets faster as you get closer to the equator. In the same way, near the poles of the nebula, where orbits were slow, the nebular material fell directly into the center. Faster moving material, on the other hand, collapsed into a flat disk revolving around the central object (<a class="xref target-figure" href="ch14.html#m59873-OSC_Astro_14_03_Step" title="Figure&#160;14.11.&#160;Steps in Forming the Solar System.">Figure&#160;14.11</a>).

These icy pieces probably formed near the present orbits of Uranus and Neptune but were ejected from their initial orbits by the gravitational influence of the giant planets.</p><p id="m59873-fs-id1163975360592"><span id="m59873-fs-id1163975360592"> </span>In the inner parts of the system, remnant planetesimals and perhaps several dozen protoplanets continued to whiz about.

Giant impacts at this stage probably stripped Mercury of part of its mantle and crust, reversed the rotation of Venus, and broke off part of Earth to create the Moon (all events we discussed in other chapters).</p><p id="m59873-fs-id1163975707568"><span id="m59873-fs-id1163975707568"> </span>Smaller-scale impacts also added mass to the inner protoplanets. Because the gravity of the giant planets could &#8220;stir up&#8221; the orbits of the planetesimals, the material impacting on the inner protoplanets could have come from almost anywhere within the solar system. In contrast to the previous stage of accretion, therefore, this new material did not represent just a narrow range of compositions.</p><p id="m59873-fs-id1163975554370"><span id="m59873-fs-id1163975554370"> </span>As a result, much of the debris striking the inner planets was ice-rich material that had condensed in the outer part of the solar nebula. As this comet-like bombardment progressed, Earth accumulated the water and various organic compounds that would later be critical to the formation of life. Mars and Venus probably also acquired abundant water and organic materials from the same source, as Mercury and the Moon are still doing to form their icy polar caps.</p><p id="m59873-fs-id1163975555723"><span id="m59873-fs-id1163975555723"> </span>Gradually, as the planets swept up or ejected the remaining debris, most of the planetesimals disappeared. In two regions, however, stable orbits are possible where leftover planetesimals could avoid impacting the planets or being ejected from the system. These regions are the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter and the Kuiper belt beyond Neptune. The planetesimals (and their fragments) that survive in these special locations are what we now call asteroids, comets, and trans-neptunian objects.</p><p id="m59873-fs-id1163975295110"><span id="m59873-fs-id1163975295110"> </span>Astronomers used to think that the solar system that emerged from this early evolution was similar to what we see today. Detailed recent studies of the orbits of the planets and asteroids, however, suggest that there were more violent events soon afterward, perhaps involving substantial changes in the orbits of Jupiter and Saturn. These two giant planets control, through their gravity, the distribution of asteroids. Working backward from our present solar system, it appears that orbital changes took place during the first few hundred million years. One consequence may have been scattering of asteroids into the inner solar system, causing the period of &#8220;heavy bombardment&#8221; recorded in the oldest lunar craters.</p></div></div><div xml:lang="en" class="section module" id="m59874"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 id="m59874"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated"/><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-n">14.4</span><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated">.&#160;</span><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t">Comparison with Other Planetary Systems<sup><a href="co03.html#book-attribution-m59874">*</a></sup></span></h2></div><div class="abstract"><div class="title"><span><span class="cnx-gentext-abstract cnx-gentext-autogenerated"/><span class="cnx-gentext-abstract cnx-gentext-t"/></span></div><p/></div></div></div><div class="toc"><ul><li class="toc-section learning-objectives"><a href="#m59874-fs-id1163975385288" class="target-section"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t">Learning Objectives</span></a></li><li class="toc-section"><a href="#m59874-fs-id1163975384524" class="target-section"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t">Discovery of Other Planetary Systems</span></a></li><li class="toc-section"><a href="#m59874-fs-id1163975397284" class="target-section"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t">Discovering Exoplanets</span></a></li><li class="toc-section"><a href="#m59874-fs-id1163975619991" class="target-section"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t">The Configurations of Other Planetary Systems</span></a></li><li class="toc-section"><a href="#m59874-fs-id1163975532455" class="target-section"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t">Comparison between Theory and Data</span></a></li></ul></div><div class="section learning-objectives" id="m59874-fs-id1163975385288"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 id="m59874-fs-id1163975385288"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated"/><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t">Learning Objectives</span></h3></div></div></div><p id="m59874-fs-id1168583123352"><span id="m59874-fs-id1168583123352"> </span>By the end of this section, you will be able to:</p><div class="itemizedlist" id="m59874-fs-id1163975525360"><span id="m59874-fs-id1163975525360"> </span><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p>Describe how the observations of protoplanetary disks provides evidence for the existence of other planetary systems</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Explain the two primary methods for detection of exoplanets</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Compare the main characteristics of other <em class="glossterm no-emphasis" id="m59874-autoid-cnx2dbk-idm140480989632480"><span id="m59874-autoid-cnx2dbk-idm140480989632480"> </span>planetary system</em><a id="idm45983364755072" class="indexterm"/>s with the features of the solar system</p></li></ul></div></div><p id="m59874-fs-id1163975696643"><span id="m59874-fs-id1163975696643"> </span>Until the middle 1990s, the practical study of the origin of planets focused on our single known example&#8212;the solar system.

Stars like our Sun are formed when dense regions in a molecular cloud (made of gas and dust) feel an extra gravitational force and begin to collapse. This is a runaway process: as the cloud collapses, the gravitational force gets stronger, concentrating material into a protostar. Roughly half of the time, the protostar will fragment or be gravitationally bound to other protostars, forming a binary or multiple star system&#8212;stars that are gravitationally bound and orbit each other. The rest of the time, the protostar collapses in isolation, as was the case for our Sun. In all cases, as we saw, conservation of angular momentum results in a spin-up of the collapsing protostar, with surrounding material flattened into a disk.

As far as we know, a giant planet cannot be formed without the condensation of water ice, and water ice is not stable so close to the heat of a star. It seems likely that all the giant planets, &#8220;hot&#8221; or &#8220;normal,&#8221; formed at a distance of several astronomical units from the star, but we now see that they did not necessarily stay there. This discovery has led to a revision in our understanding of planet formation that now includes &#8220;planet migrations&#8221; within the protoplanetary disk, or later gravitational encounters between sibling planets that scatter one of the planets inward.</p><p id="m59874-fs-id1163975352478"><span id="m59874-fs-id1163975352478"> </span>Many exoplanets have large orbital eccentricity (recall this means the orbits are not circular). High eccentricities were not expected for planets that form in a disk. This discovery provides further support for the scattering of planets when they interact gravitationally. When planets change each other&#8217;s motions, their orbits could become much more eccentric than the ones with which they began.</p><p id="m59874-fs-id1163975369674"><span id="m59874-fs-id1163975369674"> </span>There are several suggestions for ways migration might have occurred. Most involve interactions between the giant planets and the remnant material in the circumstellar disk from which they formed. These interactions would have taken place when the system was very young, while material still remained in the disk. In such cases, the planet travels at a faster velocity than the gas and dust and feels a kind of &#8220;headwind&#8221; (or friction) that causes it to lose energy and spiral inward. It is still unclear how the spiraling planet stops before it plunges into the star. Our best guess is that this plunge into the star is the fate for many protoplanets; however, clearly some migrating planets can stop their inward motions and escape this destruction, since we find hot Jupiters in many mature planetary systems.</p></div></div><div xml:lang="en" class="section module" id="m59875"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 id="m59875"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated"/><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-n">14.5</span><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated">.&#160;</span><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t">Planetary Evolution<sup><a href="co03.html#book-attribution-m59875">*</a></sup></span></h2></div><div class="abstract"><div class="title"><span><span class="cnx-gentext-abstract cnx-gentext-autogenerated"/><span class="cnx-gentext-abstract cnx-gentext-t"/></span></div><p/></div></div></div><div class="toc"><ul><li class="toc-section learning-objectives"><a href="#m59875-fs-id1163975532543" class="target-section"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t">Learning Objectives</span></a></li><li class="toc-section"><a href="#m59875-fs-id1163975759160" class="target-section"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t">Geological Activity</span></a></li><li class="toc-section"><a href="#m59875-fs-id1163975311452" class="target-section"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t">Elevation Differences</span></a></li><li class="toc-section"><a href="#m59875-fs-id1163975384524" class="target-section"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t">Atmospheres</span></a></li></ul></div><div class="section learning-objectives" id="m59875-fs-id1163975532543"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 id="m59875-fs-id1163975532543"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated"/><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t">Learning Objectives</span></h3></div></div></div><p id="m59875-fs-id1168583431656"><span id="m59875-fs-id1168583431656"> </span>By the end of this section, you will be able to:</p><div class="itemizedlist" id="m59875-fs-id1163975637394"><span id="m59875-fs-id1163975637394"> </span><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p>Describe the geological activity during the evolution of the planets, particularly on the terrestrial planets</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Describe the factors that affect differences in elevation on the terrestrial planets</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Explain how the differences in atmosphere on Venus, Earth, and Mars evolved from similar starting points in the early history of the solar system</p></li></ul></div></div><p id="m59875-fs-id1163975546758"><span id="m59875-fs-id1163975546758"> </span>While we await more discoveries and better understanding of other planetary systems, let us look again at the early history of our own solar system, after the dissipation of our dust disk. The era of giant impacts was probably confined to the first 100 million years of solar system history, ending by about 4.4 billion years ago. Shortly thereafter, the planets cooled and began to assume their present aspects. Up until about 4 billion years ago, they continued to acquire volatile materials, and their surfaces were heavily cratered from the remaining debris that hit them. However, as external influences declined, all the terrestrial planets as well as the moons of the outer planets began to follow their own evolutionary courses. The nature of this evolution depended on each object&#8217;s composition, mass, and distance from the Sun.</p><div class="section" id="m59875-fs-id1163975759160"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 id="m59875-fs-id1163975759160"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated"/><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t">Geological Activity</span></h3></div></div></div><p id="m59875-fs-id1163975554358"><span id="m59875-fs-id1163975554358"> </span>We have seen a wide range in the level of geological activity on the terrestrial planets and icy moons.

The surface gravity on Venus is nearly the same as that on Earth, but on Mars it is only about one third as great. In order for a mountain to survive, its internal strength must be great enough to support its weight against the force of gravity. Volcanic rocks have known strengths, and we can calculate that on Earth, 10 kilometers is about the limit. For instance, when new lava is added to the top of Mauna Loa in Hawaii, the mountain slumps downward under its own weight. The same height limit applies on Venus, where the force of gravity is the same as Earth&#8217;s. On Mars, however, with its lesser surface gravity, much greater elevation differences can be supported, which helps explain why Olympus Mons is more than twice as high as the tallest mountains of Venus or Earth.</p><p id="m59875-fs-id1163975569803"><span id="m59875-fs-id1163975569803"> </span>By the way, the same kind of calculation that determines the limiting height of a mountain can be used to ascertain the largest body that can have an irregular shape.

All the planets and larger moons are nearly spherical, due to the force of their own gravity pulling them into a sphere.

Early in its history, Mars apparently had a thick atmosphere with abundant liquid water, but it could not retain those conditions. The CO<sub>2</sub> necessary for a substantial greenhouse effect was lost, the temperature dropped, and eventually the remaining water froze. On Venus the reverse process took place, with a runaway greenhouse effect leading to the permanent loss of water.

The proliferation of life forms that could photosynthesize eventually led to the release of more oxygen than natural chemical reactions can remove from the atmosphere. As a result, thanks to the life on its surface, Earth finds itself with a great deficiency of CO<sub>2</sub>, with nitrogen as the most abundant gas, and the only planetary atmosphere that contains free oxygen.</p><p id="m59875-fs-id1163975658356"><span id="m59875-fs-id1163975658356"> </span>In the outer solar system, <em class="glossterm no-emphasis" id="m59875-autoid-cnx2dbk-idm140480989248384"><span id="m59875-autoid-cnx2dbk-idm140480989248384"> </span>Titan</em><a id="idm45983364554256" class="indexterm"/> is the only moon with a substantial atmosphere.

Condensation in the disk led to the formation of planetesimals, which became the building blocks of the planets. Accretion of infalling materials heated the planets, leading to their differentiation.

Different possible outcomes are illustrated by comparison of the terrestrial planets (Earth, Venus, Mars, Mercury, and the Moon). All are rocky, differentiated objects. The level of geological activity is proportional to mass: greatest for Earth and Venus, less for Mars, and absent for the Moon and Mercury. However, tides from another nearby world can also generate heat to drive geological activity, as shown by Io, Europa, and Enceladus. Pluto is also active, to the surprise of planetary scientists. On the surfaces of solid worlds, mountains can result from impacts, volcanism, or uplift. Whatever their origin, higher mountains can be supported on smaller planets that have less surface gravity. The atmospheres of the terrestrial planets may have acquired volatile materials from comet impacts. The Moon and Mercury lost their atmospheres; most volatiles on Mars are frozen due to its greater distance from the Sun and its thinner atmosphere; and Venus retained CO<sub>2</sub> but lost H<sub>2</sub>O when it developed a massive greenhouse effect. Only Earth still has liquid water on its surface and hence can support life.</p></div></div></div><!--CNX: Start Area: "For Further Exploration"--><div class="cnx-eoc further-exploration"><div class="title"><span>For Further Exploration</span></div><div class="section empty"><div class="title"><a href="#m59870"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated"/><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-n">14.</span><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated">.&#160;</span><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t">Thinking Ahead</span></a></div><div class="body"/></div><div class="section empty"><div class="title"><a href="#m59871"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated"/><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-n">14.1</span><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated">.&#160;</span><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t">Meteors</span></a></div><div class="body"/></div><div class="section empty"><div class="title"><a href="#m59872"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated"/><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-n">14.2</span><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated">.&#160;</span><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t">Meteorites: Stones from Heaven</span></a></div><div class="body"/></div><div class="section empty"><div class="title"><a href="#m59873"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated"/><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-n">14.3</span><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated">.&#160;</span><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t">Formation of the Solar System</span></a></div><div class="body"/></div><div class="section empty"><div class="title"><a href="#m59874"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated"/><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-n">14.4</span><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated">.&#160;</span><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t">Comparison with Other Planetary Systems</span></a></div><div class="body"/></div><div class="section"><div class="title"><a href="#m59875"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated"/><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-n">14.5</span><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated">.&#160;</span><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t">Planetary Evolution</span></a></div><div class="body"><p id="m59875-fs-id1163975329277"><span id="m59875-fs-id1163975329277"> </span>Note: Resources about exoplanets are provided in <a class="link target-chapter" href="ch21.html#m59915" title="21..&#160;Thinking Ahead">The Birth of Stars and the Discovery of Planets outside the Solar System</a>.</p><div class="section" id="m59875-fs-id1163975741462"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 id="m59875-fs-id1163975741462"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated"/><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t">Articles</span></h4></div></div></div><div class="section" id="m59875-fs-id1163975338832"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h5 id="m59875-fs-id1163975338832"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated"/><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t"><span class="emphasis"><em>Meteors and Meteorites</em></span></span></h5></div></div></div><p id="m59875-fs-id1163975493095"><span id="m59875-fs-id1163975493095"> </span>Alper, J. &#8220;It Came from Outer Space.&#8221; <span class="emphasis"><em>Astronomy</em></span> (November 2002): 36.
