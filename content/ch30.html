Farther out, Jupiter&#8217;s moon Europa represents the icy moons of the outer solar system. Beneath their shells of solid ice may lie vast oceans of liquid water that could support biology. Beyond our solar system are stars that host their own planets, some of which might be similar to Earth in the ability to support liquid water&#8212;and a thriving biosphere&#8212;at the planet&#8217;s surface.

Galileo, using the newly invented technology of the telescope, showed us that Earth is not the center of the solar system, but merely one of a number of objects orbiting the Sun. Our study of the stars has demonstrated that the Sun itself is a rather undistinguished star, halfway through its long main-sequence stage like so many billions of others.

A steady stream of exoplanet discoveries is leading to the conclusion that earthlike planets occur frequently&#8212;enough that there are likely many billions of &#8220;exo-Earths&#8221; in our own Milky Way Galaxy alone.

For life as we know it, that solvent is water, which has a variety of properties that are critical to how our biochemistry works. Water is abundant in the universe, but life requires that water be in liquid form (rather than ice or gas) in order to properly fill its role in biochemistry. That is the case only within a certain range of temperatures and pressures&#8212;too high or too low in either variable, and water takes the form of a solid or a gas. Identifying environments where water is present within the appropriate range of temperature and pressure is thus an important first step in identifying habitable environments.

Life on Earth makes use of two main types of energy: for you, these are the oxygen in the air you breathe and the organic molecules in your food. But life overall can use a much wider array of chemicals and, while all animals require oxygen, many bacteria do not. One of the earliest known life processes, which still operates in some modern microorganisms, combines hydrogen and carbon dioxide to make methane, releasing energy in the process. There are microorganisms that &#8220;breathe&#8221; metals that would be toxic to us, and even some that breathe in sulfur and breathe out sulfuric acid. Plants and photosynthetic microorganisms have also evolved mechanisms to use the energy in light directly.</p><p id="m59989-fs-id1168048367190"><span id="m59989-fs-id1168048367190"> </span>Water in the liquid phase, the biogenic elements, and energy are the fundamental requirements for habitability.

In fact, their coloration in part demonstrates their use of light energy&#8212;some wavelengths of incoming sunlight are selectively captured for energy; the rest are reflected back. Since it lacks the captured wavelengths, this light is now different in color than the sunlight that illuminates it. The blue part of the spring has temperatures too high to allow photosynthetic life (hence the lack of color except that supplied by water itself), but life is still present.

In addition to water, elemental raw materials, and energy, life also needs an environment in which those complicated molecules are stable (don&#8217;t break down before they can do their jobs) and their interactions are possible. Your own biochemistry works properly only within a very narrow range of about 10 &#176;C in body temperature and two-tenths of a unit in blood pH (pH is a numerical measure of acidity, or the amount of free hydrogen ions). Beyond those limits, you are in serious danger.</p><p id="m59989-fs-id1168046065056"><span id="m59989-fs-id1168046065056"> </span>Life overall must also have limits to the conditions in which it can properly work but, as we will see, they are much broader than human limits. The resources that fuel life are distributed across a very wide range of conditions. For example, there is abundant chemical energy to be had in hot springs that are essentially boiling acid (see <a class="xref target-figure" href="ch30.html#m59989-OSC_Astro_30_02_Spring" title="Figure&#160;30.7.&#160;Grand Prismatic Spring in Yellowstone National Park.">Figure&#160;30.7</a>). This provides ample incentive for evolution to fill as much of that range with life as is biochemically possible. An organism (usually a microbe) that tolerates or even thrives under conditions that most of the life around us would consider hostile, such as very high or low temperature or acidity, is known as an <em class="glossterm" id="m59989-autoid-cnx2dbk-idm140481031564656"><span id="m59989-autoid-cnx2dbk-idm140481031564656"> </span>extremophile</em><a id="idm45983346018640" class="indexterm"/> (where the suffix <span class="emphasis"><em>-phile</em></span> means &#8220;lover of&#8221;).

As a large organism, you are able to maintain an almost constant body temperature whether it is colder or warmer in the environment around you. But this is not possible at the tiny size of microorganisms; whatever the temperature in the outside world is also the temperature of the microbe, and its biochemistry must be able to function at that temperature. High temperatures are the enemy of complexity&#8212;increasing thermal energy tends to break apart big molecules into smaller and smaller bits, and life needs to stabilize the molecules with stronger bonds and special proteins. But this approach has its limits.</p><p id="m59989-fs-id1168048746283"><span id="m59989-fs-id1168048746283"> </span>Nevertheless, as noted earlier, high-temperature environments like hot springs and hydrothermal vents often offer abundant sources of chemical energy and therefore drive the evolution of organisms that can tolerate high temperatures (see <a class="xref target-figure" href="ch30.html#m59989-OSC_Astro_30_02_Vent" title="Figure&#160;30.8.&#160;Hydrothermal Vent on the Sea Floor.">Figure&#160;30.8</a>); such an organism is called a <em class="glossterm" id="m59989-autoid-cnx2dbk-idm140481038685184"><span id="m59989-autoid-cnx2dbk-idm140481038685184"> </span>thermophile</em><a id="idm45983346012144" class="indexterm"/>.

That&#8217;s amazing when you think about it. We cook our food&#8212;meaning, we alter the chemistry and structure of its biomolecules&#8212;by boiling it at a temperature of 100 &#176;C.

Early Mars had epochs of warmer and wetter conditions that would have been conducive to life at the surface. However, Mars eventually lost much of its early atmosphere and the surface water began to dry up. As that happened, the ever-shrinking reservoirs of liquid water on the martian surface became saltier and more acidic, until the surface finally had no significant liquid water and was bathed in harsh solar radiation. The surface thus became uninhabitable, but this might not be the case for the planet overall.</p><p id="m59990-fs-id1168047616495"><span id="m59990-fs-id1168047616495"> </span>Reservoirs of ice and liquid water could still exist underground, where pressure and temperature conditions make it stable.

One of Europa&#8217;s key attributes from an astrobiology perspective is that its ocean is most likely in direct contact with an underlying rocky mantle, and the interaction of water and rocks&#8212;especially at high temperatures, as within Earth&#8217;s hydrothermal vent systems&#8212;yields a <span class="emphasis"><em>reducing chemistry</em></span> (where molecules tend to give up electrons readily) that is like one half of a chemical battery.

This concept focuses on life&#8217;s requirement for liquid water, and the habitable zone is generally thought of as the range of distances from the central star in which water could be present in liquid form at a planet&#8217;s surface. In our own solar system, for example, Venus has surface temperatures far above the boiling point of water and Mars has surface temperatures that are almost always below the freezing point of water. Earth, which orbits between the two, has a surface temperature that is &#8220;just right&#8221; to keep much of our surface water in liquid form.</p><p id="m59990-fs-id1168048139286"><span id="m59990-fs-id1168048139286"> </span>Whether surface temperatures are suitable for maintaining liquid water depends on a planet&#8217;s &#8220;radiation budget&#8221; &#8212;how much starlight energy it absorbs and retains&#8212;and whether or how processes like winds and ocean circulation distribute that energy around the planet. How much stellar energy a planet receives, in turn, depends on how much and what sort of light the star emits and how far the planet is from that star,<a href="#ftn.m59990-fs-id1168047706390" class="footnote"><sup class="footnote" id="m59990-fs-id1168047706390">[26]</sup></a> how much it reflects back to space, and how effectively the planet&#8217;s atmosphere can retain heat through the greenhouse effect (see <a class="link target-chapter" href="ch08.html#m59824" title="8..&#160;Thinking Ahead">Earth as a Planet</a>). All of these can vary substantially, and all matter a lot. For example, Venus receives about twice as much starlight per square meter as Earth but, because of its dense cloud cover, also reflects about twice as much of that light back to space as Earth does. Mars receives only about half as much starlight as Earth, but also reflects only about half as much. Thus, despite their differing orbital distances, the three planets actually absorb comparable amounts of sunlight energy. Why, then, are they so dramatically different?</p><p id="m59990-fs-id1168047128001"><span id="m59990-fs-id1168047128001"> </span>As we learned in several chapters about the planets, some of the gases that make up planetary atmospheres are very effective at trapping infrared light&#8212;the very range of wavelengths at which planets radiate thermal energy back out to space&#8212;and this can raise the planet&#8217;s surface temperature quite a bit more than would otherwise be the case. This is the same &#8220;greenhouse effect&#8221; that is of such concern for global warming on our planet. Earth&#8217;s natural greenhouse effect, which comes mostly from water vapor and carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, raises our average surface temperature by about 33 &#176;C over the value it would have if there were no greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. Mars has a very thin atmosphere and thus very little greenhouse warming (about 2 &#176;C worth), while Venus has a massive carbon dioxide atmosphere that creates very strong greenhouse warming (about 510 &#176;C worth). These worlds are much colder and much hotter, respectively, than Earth would be if moved into their orbits. Thus, we must consider the nature of any atmosphere as well as the distance from the star in evaluating the range of habitability.</p><p id="m59990-fs-id1168047882926"><span id="m59990-fs-id1168047882926"> </span>Of course, as we have learned, stars also vary widely in the intensity and spectrum (the wavelengths of light) they emit. Some are much brighter and hotter (bluer), while others are significantly dimmer and cooler (redder), and the distance of the habitable zone varies accordingly. For example, the habitable zone around M-dwarf stars is 3 to 30 times closer in than for G-type (Sun-like) stars. There is a lot of interest in whether such systems could be habitable because&#8212;although they have some potential downsides for supporting life&#8212;M-dwarf stars are by far the most numerous and long-lived in our Galaxy.</p><p id="m59990-fs-id1168047998102"><span id="m59990-fs-id1168047998102"> </span>The luminosity of stars like the Sun also increases over their main-sequence lifetime, and this means that the habitable zone migrates outward as a star system ages. Calculations indicate that the power output of the Sun, for example, has increased by at least 30% over the past 4 billion years. Thus, Venus was once within the habitable zone, while Earth received a level of solar energy insufficient to keep the modern Earth (with its present atmosphere) from freezing over. In spite of this, there is plenty of geological evidence that liquid water was present on Earth&#8217;s surface billions of years ago. The phenomenon of increasing stellar output and an outwardly migrating habitable zone has led to another concept: the <span class="emphasis"><em>continuously</em></span> habitable zone is defined by the range of orbits that would remain within the habitable zone during the entire lifetime of the star system.

Earth hosts such a biosphere: the composition of our atmosphere and the spectrum of light reflected from our planet differ considerably from what would be expected in the absence of life. Presently, Earth is the only body in our solar system for which this is true, despite the possibility that habitable conditions might prevail in the subsurface of Mars or inside the icy moons of the outer solar system. Even if life exists on these worlds, it is very unlikely that it could yield planet-scale changes that are both telescopically observable and clearly biological in origin.</p><p id="m59990-fs-id1168048057391"><span id="m59990-fs-id1168048057391"> </span>What makes Earth &#8220;special&#8221; among the potentially habitable worlds in our solar system is that it has a photosynthetic biosphere. This requires the presence of liquid water at the planet&#8217;s surface, where organisms have direct access to sunlight. The habitable zone concept focuses on this requirement for surface liquid water&#8212;even though we know that subsurface habitable conditions could prevail at more distant orbits&#8212;exactly because these worlds would have biospheres detectable at a distance.</p><p id="m59990-fs-id1168047305798"><span id="m59990-fs-id1168047305798"> </span>Indeed, plants and photosynthetic microorganisms are so abundant at Earth&#8217;s surface that they affect the color of the light that our planet reflects out into space&#8212;we appear greener in visible wavelengths and reflect more near-infrared light than we otherwise would. Moreover, photosynthesis has changed Earth&#8217;s atmosphere at a large scale&#8212;more than 20% of our atmosphere comes from the photosynthetic waste product, oxygen. Such high levels would be very difficult to explain in the absence of life. Other gases, such as nitrous oxide and methane, when found simultaneously with oxygen, have also been suggested as possible indicators of life. When sufficiently abundant in an atmosphere, such gases could be detected by their effect on the spectrum of light that a planet emits or reflects. (As we saw in the chapter on exoplanets, astronomers today are beginning to have the capability of detecting the spectrum of the atmospheres of some planets orbiting other stars.)</p><p id="m59990-fs-id1168047670174"><span id="m59990-fs-id1168047670174"> </span>Astronomers have thus concluded that, at least initially, a search for life outside our solar system should focus on exoplanets that are as much like Earth as possible&#8212;roughly Earth-size planets orbiting in the habitable zone&#8212;and look for the presence of gases in the atmosphere or colors in the visible spectrum that are hard to explain except by the presence of biology. Simple, right? In reality, the search for exoplanet life poses many challenges.</p><p id="m59990-fs-id1168047738436"><span id="m59990-fs-id1168047738436"> </span>As you might imagine, this task is more challenging for planetary systems that are farther away and, in practical terms, this will limit our search to the habitable worlds closest to our own. Should we become limited to a very small number of nearby targets, it will also become important to consider the habitability of planets orbiting the M-dwarfs we discussed above.</p><p id="m59990-fs-id1168047955092"><span id="m59990-fs-id1168047955092"> </span>If we manage to separate out a clean signal from the planet and find some features in the light spectrum that might be indicative of life, we will need to work hard to think of any nonbiological process that might account for them. &#8220;Life is the hypothesis of last resort,&#8221; noted astronomer Carl Sagan&#8212;meaning that we must exhaust all other explanations for what we see before claiming to have found evidence of extraterrestrial biology. This requires some understanding of what processes might operate on worlds that we will know relatively little about; what we find on Earth can serve as a guide but also has potential to lead us astray (<a class="xref target-figure" href="ch30.html#m59990-OSC_Astro_30_03_Planet" title="Figure&#160;30.17.&#160;Spectrum of Light Transmitted through Earth&#8217;s Atmosphere.">Figure&#160;30.17</a>).</p><p id="m59990-fs-id1168047698792"><span id="m59990-fs-id1168047698792"> </span>Recall, for example, that it would be extremely difficult to account for the abundance of oxygen in Earth&#8217;s atmosphere except by the presence of biology. But it has been hypothesized that oxygen could build up to substantial levels on planets orbiting M-dwarf stars through the action of ultraviolet radiation on the atmosphere&#8212;with no need for biology.

Life has flourished on Earth for perhaps 3.5 billion years, but the atmospheric &#8220;biosignatures&#8221; that, today, would supply good evidence for life to distant astronomers have not been present for all of that time. Oxygen, for example, accumulated to detectable levels in our atmosphere only a little over 2 billion years ago. Could life on Earth have been detected before that time? Scientists are working actively to understand what additional features might have provided evidence of life on Earth during that early history, and thereby help our chances of finding life beyond.</p><div id="m59990-OSC_Astro_30_03_Planet" class="figure"><div class="body"><div class="mediaobject" id="m59990-fs-id1168047910865"><span id="m59990-fs-id1168047910865"> </span><img src="m59990/OSC_Astro_30_03_Planet.jpg" alt="In this plot the vertical axis is labeled &#8220;Percent Atmospheric Transmission&#8221;, and runs from zero at bottom to 100 at top.

Even if that life is microbial, we saw that we may soon have ways to search for chemical biosignatures. This search is of fundamental importance for understanding biology, but it does not answer the question, &#8220;Are we alone?&#8221; that we raised at the beginning of this chapter. When we ask this question, many people think of other intelligent creatures, perhaps beings that have developed technology similar to our own. If any intelligent, technical civilizations have arisen, as has happened on Earth in the most recent blink of cosmic time, how could we make contact with them?</p><p id="m59993-fs-id1168047301440"><span id="m59993-fs-id1168047301440"> </span>This problem is similar to making contact with people who live in a remote part of Earth. If students in the United States want to converse with students in Australia, for example, they have two choices. Either one group gets on an airplane and travels to meet the other, or they communicate by sending a message remotely. Given how expensive airline tickets are, most students would probably select the message route.</p><p id="m59993-fs-id1168047737047"><span id="m59993-fs-id1168047737047"> </span>In the same way, if we want to get in touch with intelligent life around other stars, we can travel, or we can try to exchange messages. Because of the great distances involved, interstellar space travel would be very slow and prohibitively expensive. The fastest spacecraft the human species has built so far would take almost 80,000 years to get to the nearest star. While we could certainly design a faster craft, the more quickly we require it to travel, the greater the energy cost involved. To reach neighboring stars in less than a human life span, we would have to travel close to the speed of light. In that case, however, the expense would become truly astronomical.</p><div class="section" id="m59993-fs-id1168047616538"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 id="m59993-fs-id1168047616538"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated"/><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t">Interstellar Travel</span></h3></div></div></div><p id="m59993-fs-id1168047944973"><span id="m59993-fs-id1168047944973"> </span>Bernard <em class="glossterm no-emphasis" id="m59993-autoid-cnx2dbk-idm140481026844688"><span id="m59993-autoid-cnx2dbk-idm140481026844688"> </span>Oliver</em><a id="idm45983345771520" class="indexterm"/>, an engineer with an abiding interest in life elsewhere, made a revealing calculation about the costs of rapid interstellar space travel. Since we do not know what sort of technology we (or other civilizations) might someday develop, Oliver considered a trip to the nearest star (and back again) in a spaceship with a &#8220;perfect engine&#8221;&#8212;one that would convert its fuel into energy with 100% efficiency. Even with a perfect engine, the energy cost of a single round-trip journey at 70% the speed of light turns out to be equivalent to several hundred thousand years&#8217; worth of total U.S. electrical energy consumption. The cost of such travel is literally out of this world.</p><p id="m59993-fs-id1168047333200"><span id="m59993-fs-id1168047333200"> </span>This is one reason astronomers are so skeptical about claims that UFOs are spaceships from extraterrestrial civilizations. Given the distance and energy expense involved, it seems unlikely that the dozens of UFOs (and even UFO abductions) claimed each year could be visitors from other stars so fascinated by Earth civilization that they are willing to expend fantastically large amounts of energy or time to reach us. Nor does it seem credible that these visitors have made this long and expensive journey and then systematically avoided contacting our governments or political and intellectual leaders.</p><p id="m59993-fs-id1168047219335"><span id="m59993-fs-id1168047219335"> </span>Not every UFO report has been explained (in many cases, the observations are sketchy or contradictory). But investigation almost always converts them to IFOs (identified flying objects) or NFOs (not-at-all flying objects). While some are hoaxes, others are natural phenomena, such as bright planets, ball lightning, fireballs (bright meteors), or even flocks of birds that landed in an oil slick to make their bellies reflective. Still others are human craft, such as private planes with some lights missing, or secret military aircraft. It is also interesting that the group of people who most avidly look at the night sky, the amateur astronomers, have never reported UFO sightings. Further, not a single UFO has ever left behind any physical evidence that can be tested in a laboratory and shown to be of nonterrestrial origin.</p><p id="m59993-fs-id1168047675409"><span id="m59993-fs-id1168047675409"> </span>Another common aspect of belief that aliens are visiting Earth comes from people who have difficulty accepting human accomplishments.

Being the lowest-frequency (and lowest-energy) band of the spectrum, they are not very expensive to produce, and we already use them extensively for communications on Earth. They are not significantly absorbed by interstellar dust and gas. With some exceptions, they easily pass through Earth&#8217;s atmosphere and through the atmospheres of the other planets we are acquainted with.</p></div><div class="section" id="m59993-fs-id1168047722365"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 id="m59993-fs-id1168047722365"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated"/><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t">The Cosmic Haystack</span></h3></div></div></div><p id="m59993-fs-id1168047968660"><span id="m59993-fs-id1168047968660"> </span>Having made the decision that radio is the most likely means of communication among intelligent civilizations, we still have many questions and a daunting task ahead of us.

In addition, it would be very expensive for an extraterrestrial civilization to broadcast on a huge number of channels. Most likely, they select one or a few channels for their particular message. Communicating on a narrow band of channels also helps distinguish an artificial message from the radio static that comes from natural cosmic processes. But the radio band contains an astronomically large number of possible channels.

Now we know they are&#8212;another example of the Copernican principle.</p><p id="m59993-fs-id1168047783690"><span id="m59993-fs-id1168047783690"> </span></p><div class="title"><b>Solution</b></div><p>

The most important conclusion from this calculation is that even if we are extremely optimistic about the probabilities, the only way we can expect success from SETI is if other civilizations are much older (and hence probably much more advanced) than ours.</p></div></div></div></div><div id="m59993-fs-id1168047353750" class="note astronomy link-to-learning"><div class="title"><span class="cnx-gentext-tip-t"/></div><div class="body"><p id="m59993-fs-id1168047311507"><span id="m59993-fs-id1168047311507"> </span>Read <a class="link" href="https://openstax.org/l/30drakeequat">Frank Drake&#8217;s own account</a> of how he came up with his &#8220;equation.&#8221; And here is a <a class="link" href="https://openstax.org/l/30frandrakinter">recent interview</a> with Frank Drake by one of the authors of this textbook.</p></div></div></div><div class="section" id="m59993-fs-id1168047596747"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 id="m59993-fs-id1168047596747"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated"/><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t">SETI outside the Radio Realm</span></h3></div></div></div><p id="m59993-fs-id1168047970229"><span id="m59993-fs-id1168047970229"> </span>For the reasons discussed above, most SETI programs search for signals at radio wavelengths. But in science, if there are other approaches to answering an unsolved question, we don&#8217;t want to neglect them.

You might think that it would be hopeless to try to detect a flash of visible light from a planet given the brilliance of the star it orbits. This is why we usually cannot measure the reflected light of planets around other stars. The feeble light of the planet is simply swamped by the &#8220;big light&#8221; in the neighborhood. So another civilization would need a mighty strong beacon to compete with their star.</p><p id="m59993-fs-id1168047662467"><span id="m59993-fs-id1168047662467"> </span>However, in recent years, human engineers have learned how to make flashes of light brighter than the Sun. The trick is to &#8220;turn on&#8221; the light for a very brief time, so that the costs are manageable. But ultra-bright, ultra-short laser pulses (operating for periods of a billionth of a second) can pack a lot of energy and can be coded to carry a message. We also have the technology to detect such short pulses&#8212;not with human senses, but with special detectors that can be &#8220;tuned&#8221; to hunt automatically for such short bursts of light from nearby stars.</p><p id="m59993-fs-id1168047845423"><span id="m59993-fs-id1168047845423"> </span>Why would any civilization try to outshine its own star in this way? It turns out that the cost of sending an ultra-short laser pulse in the direction of a few promising stars can be less than the cost of sweeping a continuous radio message across the whole sky. Or perhaps they, too, have a special fondness for light messages because one of their senses evolved using light.

It could do so by breaking apart some planets or moons and building a ring of solid material that surrounds or encloses the star and intercepts some or all of its light. This huge artificial ring or sphere might glow very brightly at infrared wavelengths, as the starlight it receives is eventually converted to heat and re-radiated into space.

Study of these worlds offers the potential to find biomarkers indicating the presence of life.</p></div></div><div class="section"><div class="title"><a href="#m59993"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated"/><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-n">30.4</span><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated">.&#160;</span><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t">The Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence</span></a></div><div class="body"><p id="m59993-fs-id1168047374360"><span id="m59993-fs-id1168047374360"> </span>Some astronomers are engaged in the search for extraterrestrial intelligent life (SETI). Because other planetary systems are so far away, traveling to the stars is either very slow or extremely expensive (in terms of energy required). Despite many UFO reports and tremendous media publicity, there is no evidence that any of these are related to extraterrestrial visits. Scientists have determined that the best way to communicate with any intelligent civilizations out there is by using electromagnetic waves, and radio waves seem best suited to the task. So far, they have only begun to comb the many different possible stars, frequencies, signal types, and other factors that make up what we call the cosmic haystack problem. Some astronomers are also undertaking searches for brief, bright pulses of visible light and infrared signatures of huge construction projects by advanced civilizations. If we do find a signal someday, deciding whether to answer and what to answer may be two of the greatest challenges humanity will face.</p></div></div></div><!--CNX: Start Area: "For Further Exploration"--><div class="cnx-eoc further-exploration"><div class="title"><span>For Further Exploration</span></div><div class="section empty"><div class="title"><a href="#m59984"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated"/><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-n">30.</span><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated">.&#160;</span><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t">Thinking Ahead</span></a></div><div class="body"/></div><div class="section empty"><div class="title"><a href="#m59988"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated"/><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-n">30.1</span><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated">.&#160;</span><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t">The Cosmic Context for Life</span></a></div><div class="body"/></div><div class="section empty"><div class="title"><a href="#m59989"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated"/><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-n">30.2</span><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated">.&#160;</span><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t">Astrobiology</span></a></div><div class="body"/></div><div class="section empty"><div class="title"><a href="#m59990"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated"/><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-n">30.3</span><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated">.&#160;</span><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t">Searching for Life beyond Earth</span></a></div><div class="body"/></div><div class="section"><div class="title"><a href="#m59993"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated"/><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-n">30.4</span><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated">.&#160;</span><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t">The Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence</span></a></div><div class="body"><div class="section" id="m59993-fs-id1168047249133"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 id="m59993-fs-id1168047249133"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated"/><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t">Articles</span></h4></div></div></div><div class="section" id="m59993-fs-id1168048148583"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h5 id="m59993-fs-id1168048148583"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated"/><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t"><span class="emphasis"><em>Astrobiology</em></span></span></h5></div></div></div><p id="m59993-fs-id1168047917248"><span id="m59993-fs-id1168047917248"> </span>Chyba, C. &#8220;The New Search for Life in the Universe.&#8221; <span class="emphasis"><em>Astronomy</em></span> (May 2010): 34.

Their message encourages us to send a radio answer, which we decide to do. Suppose our governing bodies take 2 years to decide whether and how to answer. When our answer arrives there, their governing bodies also take two of our years to frame an answer to us. How long after we get their first message can we hope to get their reply to ours? (A question for further thinking: Once communication gets going, should we continue to wait for a reply before we send the next message?)</p>
