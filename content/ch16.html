We know exactly how much energy the burning of these materials can produce. We can thus calculate that even if the immense mass of the Sun consisted of a burnable material like coal or wood, our star could not produce energy at its present rate for more than few thousand years. However, we know from geologic evidence that water was present on Earth&#8217;s surface nearly 4 billion years ago, so the Sun must have been shining brightly (and making Earth warm) at least as long as that.

Simply stated, this law says that energy cannot be created or destroyed, but can be transformed from one type to another, such as from heat to mechanical energy. The steam engine, which was key to the Industrial Revolution, provides a good example. In this type of engine, the hot steam from a boiler drives the movement of a piston, converting heat energy into motion energy.</p><p id="m59895-fs-id1170324905846"><span id="m59895-fs-id1170324905846"> </span>Conversely, motion can be transformed into heat. If you clap your hands vigorously at the end of an especially good astronomy lecture, your palms become hotter. If you rub ice on the surface of a table, the heat produced by friction melts the ice. The brakes on cars use friction to reduce speed, and in the process, transform motion energy into heat energy. That is why after bringing a car to a stop, the brakes can be very hot; this also explains why brakes can overheat when used carelessly while descending long mountain roads.</p><p id="m59895-fs-id1170325194156"><span id="m59895-fs-id1170325194156"> </span>In the nineteenth century, scientists thought that the source of the Sun&#8217;s heat might be the mechanical motion of meteorites falling into it. Their calculations showed, however, that in order to produce the total amount of energy emitted by the Sun, the mass in meteorites that would have to fall into the Sun every 100 years would equal the mass of Earth. The resulting increase in the Sun&#8217;s mass would, according to Kepler&#8217;s third law, change the period of Earth&#8217;s orbit by 2 seconds per year. Such a change would be easily measurable and was not, in fact, occurring.

This outer layer is a gas made up of individual atoms, all moving about in random directions. If a layer falls inward, the atoms acquire an additional speed because of falling motion. As the outer layer falls inward, it also contracts, moving the atoms closer together. Collisions become more likely, and some of them transfer the extra speed associated with the falling motion to other atoms. This, in turn, increases the speeds of those atoms. The temperature of a gas is a measure of the kinetic energy (motion) of the atoms within it; hence, the temperature of this layer of the Sun increases. Collisions also excite electrons within the atoms to higher-energy orbits. When these electrons return to their normal orbits, they emit photons, which can then escape from the Sun (see <a class="link target-chapter" href="ch05.html#m59791" title="5..&#160;Thinking Ahead">Radiation and Spectra</a>).</p><p id="m59895-fs-id1170325047301"><span id="m59895-fs-id1170325047301"> </span>Kelvin and Helmholtz calculated that a contraction of the Sun at a rate of only about 40 meters per year would be enough to produce the amount of energy that it is now radiating. Over the span of human history, the decrease in the Sun&#8217;s size from such a slow contraction would be undetectable.</p><p id="m59895-fs-id1170324928906"><span id="m59895-fs-id1170324928906"> </span>If we assume that the Sun began its life as a large, diffuse cloud of gas, then we can calculate how much energy has been radiated by the Sun during its entire lifetime as it has contracted from a very large diameter to its present size. The amount of energy is on the order of 10<sup>42</sup> joules. Since the solar luminosity is 4 &#215; 10<sup>26</sup> watts (joules/second) or about 10<sup>34</sup> joules per year, contraction could keep the Sun shining at its present rate for roughly 100 million years.</p><p id="m59895-fs-id1170324906170"><span id="m59895-fs-id1170324906170"> </span>In the nineteenth century, 100 million years at first seemed plenty long enough, since Earth was then widely thought to be much younger than this. But toward the end of that century and into the twentieth, geologists and physicists showed that Earth (and, hence, the Sun) is actually much older. Contraction therefore cannot be the primary source of solar energy (although, as we shall see in <a class="link target-chapter" href="ch21.html#m59915" title="21..&#160;Thinking Ahead">The Birth of Stars and the Discovery of Planets Outside the Solar System</a>, contraction is an important source of energy for a while in stars that are just being born). Scientists were thus confronted with a puzzle of enormous proportions. Either an unknown type of energy was responsible for the most important energy source known to humanity, or estimates of the age of the solar system (and life on Earth) had to be seriously modified. Charles Darwin, whose theory of evolution required a longer time span than the theories of the Sun seemed to permit, was discouraged by these results and continued to worry about them until his death in 1882.</p><p id="m59895-fs-id1170325245980"><span id="m59895-fs-id1170325245980"> </span>It was only in the twentieth century that the true source of the Sun&#8217;s energy was identified.

Let&#8217;s compare this equation of converting matter and energy to some common conversion equations that have the same form:</p><div id="m59886-fs-id1170324945270" class="equation unnumbered"><span class="label">(16.2)</span><div class="mediaobject"><img src="m59886/_autogen-svg2png-0002.png" style="width:; height:; vertical-align:-3.41pt;"/></div></div><p id="m59886-fs-id1170325078412"><span id="m59886-fs-id1170325078412"> </span>Just as each conversion formula allows you to calculate the conversion of one thing into another, when we convert matter into energy, we consider how much mass the matter has. The conversion factor in this case turns out not to be either 12 or 100, as in our examples, but another constant quantity: the speed of light squared. Note that matter does not have to travel at the speed of light (or the speed of light squared) for this conversion to occur. The factor of <span class="emphasis"><em>c</em></span><sup>2</sup> is just the number that Einstein showed must be used to relate mass and energy.</p><p id="m59886-fs-id1170325084715"><span id="m59886-fs-id1170325084715"> </span>Notice that this formula does not tell us <span class="emphasis"><em>how</em></span> to convert mass into energy, just as the formula for cents does not tell us where to exchange coins for a dollar bill. The formulas merely tell us what the equivalent values are if we succeed in making the conversion. When Einstein first derived his formula in 1905, no one had the faintest idea how to convert mass into energy in any practical way. Einstein himself tried to discourage speculation that the large-scale conversion of atomic mass into energy would be feasible in the near future. Today, as a result of developments in nuclear physics, we regularly convert mass into energy in power plants, nuclear weapons, and high-energy physics experiments in particle accelerators.</p><p id="m59886-fs-id1170325074842"><span id="m59886-fs-id1170325074842"> </span>Because the speed of light squared (<span class="emphasis"><em>c</em></span><sup>2</sup>) is a very large quantity, the conversion of even a small amount of mass results in a very large amount of energy. For example, the complete conversion of 1 gram of matter (about 1/28 ounce, or approximately 1 paperclip) would produce as much energy as the burning of 15,000 barrels of oil.</p><p id="m59886-fs-id1170325357432"><span id="m59886-fs-id1170325357432"> </span>Scientists soon realized that the conversion of mass into energy is the source of the Sun&#8217;s heat and light.

Destroying 4 million tons per second sounds like a lot when compared to earthly things, but bear in mind that the Sun is a very big reservoir of matter.

In fact, when Einstein and the great film star Charlie Chaplin met in California, they found they shared similar feelings about the loss of privacy that came with fame.

He remained there until his death in 1955, writing, lecturing, and espousing a variety of intellectual and political causes. For example, he agreed to sign a letter written by Leo Szilard and other scientists in 1939, alerting President Roosevelt to the dangers of allowing Nazi Germany to develop the atomic bomb first. And in 1952, Einstein was offered the second presidency of Israel.

The reason it was so hard to find is that neutrinos interact very weakly with other matter and therefore are very difficult to detect. Earth is more transparent to a neutrino than the thinnest and cleanest pane of glass is to a photon of light. In fact, most neutrinos can pass completely through a star or planet without being absorbed. As we shall see, this behavior of neutrinos makes them a very important tool for studying the Sun. Since Pauli&#8217;s prediction, scientists have learned a lot more about the neutrino. We now know that there are three different types of neutrinos, and in 1998, neutrinos were discovered to have a tiny amount of mass. Indeed, it is so tiny that electrons are at least 500,000 times more massive. Ongoing research is focused on determining the mass of neutrinos more precisely, and it may still turn out that one of the three types is massless.

This will cause them to lose some of their mass, which then turns into energy. However, every nucleus, even simple hydrogen, has protons&#8212;and protons all have positive charges. Since like charges repel via the electrical force, the closer we get two nuclei to each other, the more they repel. It&#8217;s true that if we can get them within &#8220;striking distance&#8221; of the nuclear force, they will then come together with a much stronger attraction. But that striking distance is very tiny, about the size of a nucleus. How can we get nuclei close enough to participate in fusion?</p><p id="m59886-fs-id1170325176178"><span id="m59886-fs-id1170325176178"> </span>The answer turns out to be heat&#8212;tremendous heat&#8212;which speeds the protons up enough to overcome the electrical forces that try to keep protons apart. Inside the Sun, as we saw, the most common element is hydrogen, whose nucleus contains only a single proton. Two protons can fuse only in regions where the temperature is greater than about 12 million K, and the speed of the protons average around 1000 kilometers per second or more. (In old-fashioned units, that&#8217;s over 2 million miles per hour!)</p><p id="m59886-fs-id1170325244913"><span id="m59886-fs-id1170325244913"> </span>In our Sun, such extreme temperatures are reached only in the regions near its center, which has a temperature of 15 million K.

This is, however, only the <span class="emphasis"><em>average</em></span> waiting time. Some of the enormous numbers of protons in the Sun&#8217;s inner region are &#8220;lucky&#8221; and take only a few collisions to achieve a fusion reaction: they are the protons responsible for producing the energy radiated by the Sun. Since the Sun is about 4.5 billion years old, most of its protons have not yet been involved in fusion reactions.</p></div><div class="section" id="m59886-fs-id1170325055979"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 id="m59886-fs-id1170325055979"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated"/><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t">Nuclear Reactions in the Sun&#8217;s Interior</span></h3></div></div></div><p id="m59886-fs-id1170324933114"><span id="m59886-fs-id1170324933114"> </span>The <em class="glossterm no-emphasis" id="m59886-autoid-cnx2dbk-idm140480996088240"><span id="m59886-autoid-cnx2dbk-idm140480996088240"> </span>Sun</em><a id="idm45983362991712" class="indexterm"/>, then, taps the energy contained in the nuclei of atoms through nuclear <em class="glossterm no-emphasis" id="m59886-autoid-cnx2dbk-idm140480996087520"><span id="m59886-autoid-cnx2dbk-idm140480996087520"> </span>fusion</em><a id="idm45983362990128" class="indexterm"/>.

The Sun can maintain its high temperature and energy output for billions of years through the fusion of the simplest element in the universe, hydrogen. Because most of the Sun (and the other stars) is made of hydrogen, it is an ideal &#8220;fuel&#8221; for powering a star. As will be discussed in the following chapters, we can define a star as a ball of gas capable of getting its core hot enough to initiate the fusion of hydrogen. There are balls of gas that lack the mass required to do this (Jupiter is a local example); like so many hopefuls in Hollywood, they will never be stars.</p><div id="m59886-fs-id1170325047754" class="note astronomy making-connections"><div class="title"><span class="cnx-gentext-tip-t">Fusion on Earth</span></div><div class="body"><p id="m59886-fs-id1170324943586"><span id="m59886-fs-id1170324943586"> </span>Wouldn&#8217;t it be wonderful if we could duplicate the Sun&#8217;s energy mechanism in a controlled way on Earth?

Fusion energy would have many advantages: it would use hydrogen (or deuterium, which is heavy hydrogen) as fuel, and there is abundant hydrogen in Earth&#8217;s lakes and oceans. Water is much more evenly distributed around the world than oil or uranium, meaning that a few countries would no longer hold an energy advantage over the others. And unlike fission, which leaves dangerous byproducts, the nuclei that result from fusion are perfectly safe.</p><p id="m59886-fs-id1170325091806"><span id="m59886-fs-id1170325091806"> </span>The problem is that, as we saw, it takes extremely high temperatures for nuclei to overcome their electrical repulsion and undergo fusion.

How do we know that the Sun is actually this hot? To determine what the interior of the Sun might be like, it is necessary to resort to complex calculations. Since we can&#8217;t see the interior of the Sun, we have to use our understanding of physics, combined with what we see at the surface, to construct a mathematical model of what must be happening in the interior. Astronomers use observations to build a computer program containing everything they think they know about the physical processes going on in the Sun&#8217;s interior. The computer then calculates the temperature and pressure at every point inside the Sun and determines what nuclear reactions, if any, are taking place. For some calculations, we can use observations to determine whether the computer program is producing results that match what we see. In this way, the program evolves with ever-improving observations.</p><p id="m59887-fs-id1170325248260"><span id="m59887-fs-id1170325248260"> </span>The computer program can also calculate how the Sun will change with time.

Ultimately, the changes in the center could be catastrophic, since eventually all the hydrogen fuel hot enough for fusion will be exhausted. Either a new source of energy must be found, or the Sun will cease to shine. We will describe the ultimate fate of the Sun in later chapters.

A steak sitting on the surface of the skillet picks up heat energy by the particles in the surface of the skillet colliding with particles on the surface of the steak.

The intense magnetic field associated with the sunspot stops the upward flow of hot material and creates a kind of plug that blocks the hot gas. As the material above the plug cools (shown in blue), it becomes denser and plunges inward, drawing more gas and more magnetic field behind it into the spot. The concentrated magnetic field causes more cooling, thereby setting up a self-perpetuating cycle that allows a spot to survive for several weeks. Since the plug keeps hot material from flowing up into the sunspot, the region below the plug, represented by red in this picture, becomes hotter. This material flows sideways and then upward, eventually reaching the solar surface in the area surrounding the sunspot.

As input for these calculations, we use what we know about the Sun. It is made entirely of hot gas. Apart from some very tiny changes, the Sun is neither expanding nor contracting (it is in hydrostatic equilibrium) and puts out energy at a constant rate. Fusion of hydrogen occurs in the center of the Sun, and the energy generated is carried to the surface by radiation and then convection. A solar model describes the structure of the Sun&#8217;s interior. Specifically, it describes how pressure, temperature, mass, and luminosity depend on the distance from the center of the Sun.</p></div></div><div class="section"><div class="title"><a href="#m59888"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated"/><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-n">16.4</span><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated">.&#160;</span><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t">The Solar Interior: Observations</span></a></div><div class="body"><p id="m59888-fs-id1170326145292"><span id="m59888-fs-id1170326145292"> </span>Studies of solar oscillations (helioseismology) and neutrinos can provide observational data about the Sun&#8217;s interior. The technique of helioseismology has so far shown that the composition of the interior is much like that of the surface (except in the core, where some of the original hydrogen has been converted into helium), and that the convection zone extends about 30% of the way from the Sun&#8217;s surface to its center. Helioseismology can also detect active regions on the far side of the Sun and provide better predictions of solar storms that may affect Earth. Neutrinos from the Sun call tell us about what is happening in the solar interior. A recent experiment has shown that solar models do predict accurately the number of electron neutrinos produced by nuclear reactions in the core of the Sun. However, two-thirds of these neutrinos are converted into different types of neutrinos during their long journey from the Sun to Earth, a result that also indicates that neutrinos are not massless particles.</p></div></div></div><!--CNX: Start Area: "For Further Exploration"--><div class="cnx-eoc further-exploration"><div class="title"><span>For Further Exploration</span></div><div class="section empty"><div class="title"><a href="#m59880"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated"/><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-n">16.</span><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated">.&#160;</span><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t">Thinking Ahead</span></a></div><div class="body"/></div><div class="section empty"><div class="title"><a href="#m59895"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated"/><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-n">16.1</span><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated">.&#160;</span><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t">Sources of Sunshine: Thermal and Gravitational Energy</span></a></div><div class="body"/></div><div class="section empty"><div class="title"><a href="#m59886"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated"/><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-n">16.2</span><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated">.&#160;</span><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t">Mass, Energy, and the Theory of Relativity</span></a></div><div class="body"/></div><div class="section empty"><div class="title"><a href="#m59887"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated"/><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-n">16.3</span><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated">.&#160;</span><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t">The Solar Interior: Theory</span></a></div><div class="body"/></div><div class="section"><div class="title"><a href="#m59888"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated"/><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-n">16.4</span><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated">.&#160;</span><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t">The Solar Interior: Observations</span></a></div><div class="body"><div class="section" id="m59888-fs-id1170325072926"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 id="m59888-fs-id1170325072926"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated"/><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t">Articles</span></h4></div></div></div><p id="m59888-fs-id1170326129618"><span id="m59888-fs-id1170326129618"> </span>Harvey, J. et al. &#8220;GONG: To See Inside Our Sun.&#8221; <span class="emphasis"><em>Sky &amp; Telescope</em></span> (November 1987): 470.</p><p id="m59888-fs-id1170326272873"><span id="m59888-fs-id1170326272873"> </span>Hathaway, D. &#8220;Journey to the Heart of the Sun.&#8221; <span class="emphasis"><em>Astronomy</em></span> (January 1995): 38.</p><p id="m59888-fs-id1170326471152"><span id="m59888-fs-id1170326471152"> </span>Kennedy, J. &#8220;GONG: Probing the Sun&#8217;s Hidden Heart.&#8221; <span class="emphasis"><em>Sky &amp; Telescope</em></span> (October 1996): 20.
